  "description": "This plugin lets your search pattern be specific to \nthat buffer. This is especially handy when one \nworks with multiple windows and wants different\nsearch pattern highlighted in different windows.\n\nNormally  if you do :/abc in one window, all other\nwindows will also highlight \"abc\".\nNow by using this plugin you can do\n:Bs abc    which will highlight \"abc\" only in that\nwindow.  Likewise you can have multiple search\npattern highlighted in different windows.\n\nSide Effects: This plugin will unset hlsearch option\n\n-ncr",
