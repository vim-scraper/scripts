  "description": "SearchFold is a good script to have around. You give it a search string to find and folds everything except for the lines where the string matches. By default is keeps some non-matching lines around so you can get an idea of where you are in the file and gives you the ability to expand the view for a particular match to get more context. After you are done looking around you can quit the script and keep the fold or go back to the file as it was (restoring any previous folds).\n\nCheck  out this page for a screen shot.\nhttp://juan.axisym3.net/vim-plugins/#searchfold",
  "install_details": "1. Read the section titled 'Options'\n2. Setup any variables need in your vimrc file\n3. Copy 'searchfold.vim' to your plugin directory.",
