  "description": "This ftplugin eases the editing of IkiWiki wikis, by letting you \"follow\" the wikilinks on your file (page), and loading the file associated with a given wikilink in vim. The plugin takes care of following the ikiwiki linking rules to figure out which file a wikilink points to\n\nThe plugin also includes commands (and mappings) to make the cursor jump to the previous/next wikilink in the current file\n\n#  Jumping to pages\n\nTo open the file associated to a wikilink, place the cursor over its text, and hit Enter (<CR>). This functionality is also available through the :IkiJumpToPage command\n\n# Moving to next/previous wikilink in current file\n\nCtrl-j will move the cursor to the next wikilink. Ctrl-k will move it to the previous wikilink. This functionality is also available through the :IkiNextWikiLink command. This command takes one argument, the direction to move into\n\n  * :IkiNextWikiLink 0 will look forward for the wikilink\n  * :IkiNextWikiLink 1 will look backwards for the wikilink\n\n# Current issues:\n\n  * The plugin only works for wikilinks contained in a single text line; multiline wikilinks are not (yet) seen as such\n\n# Notes\n\nThe latest version of this script can be found in the following location\n\nhttp://git.devnull.li/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=ikiwiki-nav.git;a=blob;f=ftplugin/ikiwiki_nav.vim;hb=HEAD\n\nAny feedback you can provide is appreciated; the contact details can be found inside the plugin",
