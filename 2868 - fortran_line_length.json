  "description": "-*- vim -*-\nFILE: fortran_line_length.vim\nVim plugin\n\nDESCRIPTION:\nAccording to the file extension of a FORTRAN source file, this plugin sets a valid line length.\nAny characters occurring after this column are considered as error, and are matched so by highlighting.\n\nThis plugin is run automatically. But, if you want to use any other valid size for some reason, the commands are available.\n\nFor a screenshot, see\nhttp://caglartoklu.blogspot.com/2009/12/fortran-valid-line-length-plugin-for.html\n\nLAST MODIFICATION: 2010-04-23\n(C) Copyright 2009 Caglar Toklu <caglartoklu[aat]gmail.com>\nMaintained by Caglar Toklu <caglartoklu[aat]gmail.com>\nVERSION: 0.0.3\n\nCHANGELOG:\n- 0.0.3, 2010-04-23\n  - FIX: Loosing the match ID after removing the match in another buffer.\n  - Priority can be customized.\n  - Group name can be customized if necessary.\n  - Script will not load itself if it has been loaded before.\n  - Script is now respecting the script ID to avoid clashes with others.\n- 0.0.2, 2009-12-07\n  - The display format for match is now read from the global variable g:FORTRANMatchDisplayFormat instead of hard coded settings.\n    Now you can adapt it to your favorite colorscheme within VIMRC without modifiying the plugin itself.\n  - The file is saved in UNIX file format instead of Windows.\n- 0.0.1, 2009-11-23\n  - First version.\n\nOPTIONS:\nThese are options that can be customized from your VIMRC:\n- g:FORTRANMatchDisplayFormat\n  The format/color of the matched characters.\n  The default is:\n  let g:FORTRANMatchDisplayFormat = 'guifg=#FF0000'\n- g:let g:FORTRANMatchGroup\n  The name of the match group. Changing this is generally unnecessary, do it if another plugin uses the same group name.\n  The default is:\n  g:let g:FORTRANMatchGroup = 'FortranLineMatch'\n- g:let g:FORTRANMatchPriority\n  The priority, Vim's default is 10.\n  If some other highlighting group shadows this one, or this one is shadowing another one, you can change it.\n  Higher number gives higher priority.\n  The default is:\n  g:let g:FORTRANMatchPriority = 10\n\nUSAGE:\nAll commands defined by this plugin starts with 'FORTRAN'.\nSo, you can type :FORTRAN and press tab to see the available values.\n\nREFERENCES:\nhttp://gnu.huihoo.org/gcc/gcc-3.3.6/g77/Fortran-Dialect-Options.html\nhttp://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/805-4939/6j4m0vn6l?a=view",
