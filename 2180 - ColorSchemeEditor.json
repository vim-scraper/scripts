  "description": "This plugin provides a GUI tool which simplifies creating/editing Vim\ncolorscheme files.  It consists of a Vim plugin as well as a Python program,\nand utilizes Vim's command server interface |clientserver| for communications.\n\nNew in version 1.1:\nThe list of highlight groups now displays a swatch of the current foreground/\nbackground colors.  You can see right away which colors are used for each\nhighlight group.  \nAfter getting some negative feedback over my last few colorscheme contributions,\nI have added a readability column to this tool that analyses the color contrast \nbetween foreground and background colors.  I hope that this will lead to \ncolorschemes that are easy on the eyes for all Vim users.\n\nSee the screenshots:\n\nhttp://i49.servimg.com/u/f49/12/09/64/12/metada10.jpg\nhttp://i49.servimg.com/u/f49/12/09/64/12/colors10.png\n\nThe goals that I hope to achieve through this plugin are to improve the\nquality of existing colorschemes by allowing the authors the freedom to create\ncolorschemes in a natural WYSIWYG fashion.  Immediate visual feedback lets the\nauthor quickly assess the effects of their changes, and allows them to easily\nchoose just the right color for a highlight element.  By displaying all of the\n\"preferred\" highlight groups in a treeview, colorscheme authors can ensure\nthat all of the important highlights have been changed to fit in with the\noverall scheme.  Users of colorschemes can use this plugin to tweak their\nfavorite colorschemes more to their liking.\n\nColorschemes generated with this plugin are backwards-compatible with earlier\nversions of Gvim that do not use such highlight groups as CursorLine or Pmenu.\n\nYour palette of custom colors is saved in the colorscheme file, so that your\nchoices persist between editing sessions.  This helps you maintain\na consistent look-and-feel while you are in the process of creating the\ncolorscheme.  Other metadata related to the colorscheme, such as licensing\ninformation and your contact information are accessible from within the editor\nas well.\n\nThis plugin makes a nice compliment to my earlier work, ColorSchemeMenuMaker.\n    http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2004\n\nIf you have already installed ColorSchemeMenuMaker, the menu entry for\nColorSchemeEditor will appear at the bottom of the \"ColorSchemes\" menu item.\nAdditionally, you may invoke it via the :ColorSchemeEditor command.\n\nSend bugs, suggestions, flames, etc. to NOSPAMewfalor@NOSPAMgmail.com - NOSPAM.\n\n",

  "install_details": "ColorSchemeEditor requires that your version of Vim is compiled with the |gui|\nand |clientserver| features.\n\nThe GUI editor is written with Python, with PyGTK and Glade comprising the\ngraphical interface.\n\nIf you want to use this on Un*x systems, make sure you have those three\npackages and their dependencies installed.\n\nMore specifically, Gentoo users will need at least the following packages:\ndev-lang/python x11-libs/gtk+ gnome-base/libglade dev-python/pygtk\n\nUbuntu users will need at least these packages: libglade2-0, python, python-gtk2, python-glade2\n\n\nWindows users will need at least the following software packages:\nPython       http://www.python.org/download/\nPyGTK        http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html\nPygobject    See above\nPycairo      See above\ngladewin32   http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net/modules/news/\n\nOnce the requisite software packages are installed, simply unzip the plugin\npackage into your ~/.vim (or ~/vimfiles) directory.  The\nColorSchemeEditor.{py,vim,glade} files should all wind up in the plugin\ndirectory.\n\nAny new instances of Gvim will now show the 'ColorSchemes' menu, and are ready\nto go.  Within already running instances of Gvim, you may execute\n\n    :runtime plugin/ColorSchemeEditor.vim \n\nto load the plugin.\n\nAlso, you should run helptags: \n\n    :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc\n",
