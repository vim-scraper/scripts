  "description": "You can use this plugin's basic functionality to set up a list of\nfrequently-accessed files for easy navigation. The list of files\nwill be displayed in a window on the left side of the Vim\nwindow, and you can press <Return> or double-click on\nfilenames in the list to open the files. This is similar to how\nsome IDEs I've used work. I find this easier to use than\nhaving to navigate a directory hierarchy with the file-explorer.\nIt also obviates the need for a buffer explorer because you\nhave your list of files on the left of the Vim Window.\n\n\nBut there's much, much more . . . .\n\nYou can also instruct the Plugin to change to a directory and\nto run scripts when you select a file. These scripts can, for\nexample, modify the environment to include compilers in\n$PATH. This makes it very easy to use quickfix with multiple\nprojects that use different environments. I give examples in\nthe documentation.\n\nOther features include:\n\to Loading/Unloading all the files in a Project (\\l, \\L, \\w, and \\W)\n\to Grepping all the files in a Project (\\g and \\G)\n\to Running a user-specified script on a file (can be used\n\t  to launch an external program on the file) (\\1 through \\9)\n\to Running a user-specified script on all the files in a Project\n\t  (\\f1-\\f9 and \\F1-\\F9)\n\to Also works with the netrw plugin using directory\n\t  names like ftp://remotehost\n             (Good for webpage maintenance.)\n\to Support for custom mappings for version control\n\t  integration (example of perforce in the documentation).\n\to I also give an example in the documentation on how to \n\t  set up a custom launcher based on extension. The\n\t  example launches *.jpg files in a viewer. I have also set\n\t  up viewers for PDF (acroread) and HTML files (mozilla)\n\t  for my own use.\n\nThis plugin is known to work on Linux, Solaris, and Windows.\nI cannot test it on Windows, though, so please let me know if\nyou run into any problems. If you use it on other platforms,\nlet me know.\n\n(Let me know if you need a .zip file)\n",

The previous version works in 7.0, but there was an annoying redraw when you move into/out of the project window.\n-Also, 7.0 treats modelines a little bit differently than 6.x. Version 7.0 re-evaluates window-local modelines if you hide and show the project window, and this messes up folds if you have a foldlevel in your project file's modelines.  Modelines are now turned off after the project file is first loaded.\n-Added \\S (Split-load all files at the cursor level) contributed by A. Harrison.\n-Bug fix with misuse of winnr() when winbufnr() should have been used."
