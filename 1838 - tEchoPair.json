  "description": "VIM is an excellent editor but in comparison too e.g. emacs it lacks a \nminor feature that makes editing lisp code somewhat cumbersome. While \nVIM can highlight the matching parenthesis, this doesn't help much with \nlong functions when the matching parenthesis is off the screen. \nEmacs users are better off in such a situation, since emace displays the \nmatching line in the echo area.\n\nThis plugin tries to mimic Emacs's behaviour. Whenever the cursor is \nplaced over a parenthesis or an element of a pair the matching element is \ndisplayed in the echo area. If 'cmdheight' is set to a value greater \nthan 1, additional context lines are displayed, too.\n\n\nIn order to enable this plugin, you choose between the following  \noptions:\n    TEchoPairInstallBuffer ... enable for the current buffer\n\n    call TEchoPairInstall('*') ... enable globally\n\n    let g:tEchoPairInstall = ['lisp', 'scheme'] ... enable for certain \n      filetypes\n\n\nCurrently, there are the following display modes:\n    indicate ... Display the whole line and highlight the matching \n      parenthesis. If 'cmdheight' is greater than 1, additional lines \n      are display.\n\n    inner ... Display the inner text Emacs-style.\n\nIn order to see the matching parenthesis when 'showmode' is on, set \n'cmdheight' to something greater than 1.\n\nYou can select the preferred display mode on a filetype basis, by \nsetting g:tEchoPairStyle_{STYLE}.\n\nExample:\n    let g:tEchoPairStyle_inner = ['lisp', 'scheme']\n    let g:tEchoPairStyle_indicate = ['java']\n\n\nThe pairs are usually deduced from the value of 'matchpairs' unless \nthere is an entry for the current buffer's filetype in g:tEchoPairs. For \nthe following filetypes custom pairs are pre-defined:\n    - ruby\n    - vim\n\nBUT: It actually only works for lisp-like languages.\n",
