This plugin\nprovides the following benefits: \n    1. Vim's editing keystrokes.\n    2. You can resize the window so that the entire value\n       fits on the screen.\n    3. You can easily use the value of a different variable\n       in the definition of another.\n    4. Vim shows up in the taskbar, so you don't have to\n       minimize all of your other windows to find the\n       misplaced \"Environment Variables\" dialog after looking\n       up the correct value for a variable in the\n       documentation.\n    5. Command-line completion is an easier way to locate\n       a variable than hunting for it in two different\n       five-line high lists.\n\nAt the command-line type this command: :EnvEdit {VARIABLE}\nThis will open a new buffer named $VARIABLE and containing the\nvalue of that environment variable.  If there exists no such\nenvironment variable, you'll be greeted with an empty buffer.\n\nWhen the buffer is saved, the new text is stored in the\ndefault register \"\", exported to the clipboard via the \"+ and \"*\nregisters, and exported to Vim's own environment.  This means\nthat any child processes of that instance of Vim inherit the\nnew environment variable.\n\nIf the environment variable contains your system's path\nseparator character (':' on UNIX and ';' on Windows), the\nvariable's text is split on this character and each component\nis presented on its own line.  When you save the buffer, all\nlines are joined and delimited by this same character.  Empty\nlines are filtered out to prevent consecutive path separators\nfrom appearing.\n",
