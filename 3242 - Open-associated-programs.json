  "install_details": "Unzip the most recent ZIP archive file (see below) inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is \"~/.vim\" on UNIX and \"%USERPROFILE%\\vimfiles\" on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command \":helptags ~/.vim/doc\" (use \":helptags ~\\vimfiles\\doc\" instead on Windows).\n\nNote that on Windows a command prompt window pops up when either of the functions is called. If this bothers you then you can install my shell.vim plug-in (see vimscript #3123) which includes a DLL that works around this issue. Once youve installed both plug-ins it should work out of the box!",
