  "description": "Inspired by Emmanuel Touzery tip:\n\" http://vim.sourceforge.net/tip_view.php?tip_id=332 \n\" and discussion below (thanks to Luc for pluginization hints) \n\" I added functions and turned it into vim script.\n\n\n\" Commands:\n\" <Leader>f (in insert mode) - inserts footnotemark, opens at bottom window where\n\"     footnotemark is also inserted and you are ready to type in your\n\"     footnotetext.\n\" <Leader>r (in insert mode) - closes footnote window and returns to the text in\n\"     proper place. \n\"\n\" You can change them by placing in your vimrc:\n\"  imap your_map <Plug>AddVimFootnote\n\"  imap your_map <Plug>ReturnFromFootnote\n\"\n\"\n\"    Footnotes are placed at the end of the file but above signature delimiter\n\"    (is one exists). \n\"\n\" Settings:\n\" g:vimfootnotetype - possible values:\n\" \tarabic (default) - [1] [2] [3] ...\n\" \talpha  - [a] [b] ... [z] [aa] [bb] ... [zz] [a] ...\n\"   Alpha  - as above but uppercase [A] ...\n\"   star   - [*] [**] [***] ...\t\n\"\n\" Additional commands:\n\" FootnoteNumber:\n\" \tYou can change current footnote number (one obligatory argument)\n\"   :FootnoteNumber 5\t\n\" FootnoteNumberRestore:\n\"\tYou can restore old footnote number  \n\"\t:FootnoteNumberRestore\t\n\" FootnoteUndo: \n\"\tDecrease footnote counter by 1\n\"\t:FootnoteUndo\t \n\" FootnoteMeta:\n\" \tChange type of the footnotes and restart counter (1, a, A, *)\n\" \t:FootnoteMeta\n\" \t\tIf your previous footnote type was alpha, Alpha or star new type will\n\" \t\tbe arabic.\n\" \t\tIf your previous footnote type was arabic new type will be alpha.\n\" \t:FootnoteMeta name_of_the_type\n\" \t\tChange footnote type to name_of_the_type. If name_of_the_type is the\n\" \t\tsame as\tyour current footnote type nothing would be changed.\n\" FootnoteRestore:\n\" \tRestore previous footnote type and counter. Unfortunately there is no easy\n\" \tway to sort footnotes at the end of file without handmade :!sort on marked\n\" \tlines (it doesn't work for 'star' type).\n\" \t:FootnoteRestore\t\n\"\n\" For easier work with this commands I would suggest place this lines in your\n\" vimrc (they offer very nice competion of Vim commands):\t\n\"\tset laststatus=2\n\"\tset wildmode=longest,list\n\"\tset wildmenu\n\"\n\" And/or map :FootnoteComs for something you like.\n\"\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n",
