Well, this file is for you ! \n\nIn order to use it, source this file or delete its last line and call DelFromCC() by yourself.\n\nIt works fine with MUTT and ELM ; I haven't test any other MUA. MUTT defines the option metoo that should handle this... I've never successed to make it work properly :-((",
