Cvs was unable to automatically merge one's local version of such files with the repository's version, and so merging requires human intervention.  The :CVSconflict command takes the current conflict file, splits it into two separate files, and enables vimdiff-style editing and viewing.\n\nA command,\n\n  :CVSconflict\n\nis provided which transforms the current file containing cvs conflict sections such as\n\n  <<<<<<<\n  ...local version...\n  =======\n  ...repository version...\n  >>>>>>>\n\ninto two side by side versions.  Vim&#039s diff mode is enabled with these two windows, greatly facilitating the production of a merged file.\n\n(alpha/beta version available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#CVSCONFLICT)\n",
