  "description": "This plugin intends to provide facilities to manage sets of files. For\nexample :\n. to create files from visited directory trees and files\n. to apply Vim commands on opened files\nIn fact, it autorizes files and dirs manipulation in many ways\n\nAs this plugin can manage many parameters, i decided to put these parameters\nin an ini file. Doing so allows you to deal with many mass treatments.\nIn this ini file, you can specify\n. a set of root dirs which trees will be visited. For Each root dir, you can\n  define other parameters you estimate useful\n. Parameters that contain strings to be written in the outfile :\n  . at begining and end of the file (can be connect string for command\n    files)\n  . entering and going out the root dirs\n  . entering and going out the visited dirs\n  . before and after the files found\n  These parameters can contain vim commands (between {{...}}) so you can do\n  whatever you want with the file names\n. You also have parameters that define\n  . a wildcard to filter the files\n  . a vim command to apply to the files found\n    This command may be written in the iniFile but may also be passed as a\n    parameter of the Walk command. If one command is written in the ini file\n    and another is passed to the Walk command, the inifile one is\n    overwritten by the parameter\n    If you want a result to be written in the outfile, this result may be\n    written in a register (cf help)\n  . the name of the outfile\nYou've got a complete example of ini file (example.ini) that can be used to\nsee how this plugin reacts. You just have to modify <SourceDir> and\n<OutFile> parameter.\nOther iniFile examples have been put in the package :\n. One is to generate a tag file with the names of the files found (exTagGen)\n. Another is to generate a file to prepare a syntax file to color the names\n  of the files found (to be used after exTagGen) (exColTagGen)\n  This is not very useful for source files but may be interesting to manage\n  simple text files with cross references\n. The last is to generate a directory tree (good for CDs' TOC) (exTreeGen)\n\nFeatures\nWGoIniDir     : Change the current dir to the inifiles dir. This is to ease\n                manipulation of inifiles\nWSetIniFile   : Initialise the inifile global variable\nWAddIniFile   : Add the filename passed to the inifile global variable\nWEditIniFile  : edits the inifile which name in passed. If this file is\n                empty, it is initialized with the content of \"skeleton.ini\"\n\nWalk          : launch the action, taking the inifiles wich names are\n                written in the inifile global variable. Walk accepts an optional\n                parameter that contains a vim command to be applied on the\n                files found. A powerful way of using this is to define\n                user-commands (:help user-commands)\n\nThere is other ways to launch the walk operation : you can call the walk\nfunction that way :\n:call Walk(cmd,inifile)\nAll the arguments must be provided (with no completion).\n:call Walk(\"\",iniFile)\nYou can write more than one ini files in the \"i\" register and type\n:call Walk(\"\",\"\") or\n:call Walk(cmd,\"\")\n\nNote : if you use the windows way of calling directories (with \\), you must\nbe careful : you have to write\n:call Walk(cmd,'D:\\my\\directory\\myIniFile.ini')\nor\n:call Walk(cmd,\"D:\\\\my\\\\directory\\\\myIniFile.ini\")\n\nNote2: This plugin may be difficult to understand at first glance. Don't hesitate to ask me if you need some more explanation...\n\n\nAdvertising :\nHave you heard of this other funny script ?\n\nIf you find this script  too serious, try this other one : \nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=800\nWith this script you'll be able to MixCase like the best HaRÐco®É mI×CaSE mAs+êR and make your coding very new style ;-)",
  "install_details": "Warning : this plugin uses python\n\nIt is made of four files : Walk.vim, Walk.py, FicIni.py and walk.txt.\nThe .vim file is to be dropped in the plugins directory, the .txt in the doc\ndirectory and the .py in a directory declared in the python path by a little >\n\tlet $PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH . \"/MyDirectory/Python\"\nin your .vimrc\n\nyou also have an .ini file examples (example.ini, exTagGen.ini,\nexColTagGen.ini and exTreeGen) and a skeleton for .ini files (skeleton.ini).\nThese files are to be dropped in an inifiles directory (you decide).\nSkeleton.ini is used by the WEditIniFile command.\nTo use the examples, you'll have to edit them to change the <SourceDir> and\nthe <OutFile> parameter\n\nTo ease the edition of the ini files, you have to init another variable in\nyour .vimrc ($WALKINIDIR): >\n\tlet $WALKINIDIR = \"MyDirectory/iniFiles\"\n\nTo init the help tags, start Vim and do either\n:helptags ~/.vim/doc (for unix)\nor\n:helptags ~\\vimfiles\\doc (for MSWindows)\nto rebuild the tags file. Do \":help add-local-help\" for more details.\n\nNOTE:\nFicIni.py provides a class to parse xml ini files (details in FicIni.py)\n\n",
