  "description": "For Windows users, this plugin will allow you to add a button in Microsoft Outlook which will create a new buffer in Vim with the body of the current email.  The buffer can be edited in a specific instance of Vim and you can choose whether to use tabs.\n\nThe filetype of the buffer is automatically set to \"mail\".  This allows you to use all of Vim's great plugins and editing features to alter the email and customize the buffer using Vim's standard filetype support.  When finished, simply saving the file will automatically update the body of the email in Microsoft Outlook.\n\nThis has been tested with Outlook 2003 (WinXP SP3) and Outlook 2007 (Windows 7 64bit and 32bit).\n\nThere are a number of preferences you can set within the plugin to customize it for your use.  \nThese settings can be explored here:\n:h outlook-configuration\n:h outlook.txt\n\nInstallation instructions for Outlook can be found here:\n:h outlook-macro\n:h outlook.txt\n\nNOTE:  All code is included in these files.  There are no executables you need to run on your system.   For those interested, the documentation outlines how Vim and Outlook communicate with each other.\n\nPlease use the VimWiki (link at top of page) to post comments and suggestions.\nI routinely monitor the vim_use group.\n\n\n",
