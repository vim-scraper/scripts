  "description": "A terminal/shell buffer script for python enabled [g]vim (+python).  Allows execution of shell commands in a vim buffer.\nIt does not use r! <cmd>.  \n\nSome of it's features:\n\n* It retains state because it's interactive.  Set an environment variable and it \"stays\" because the shell process is the same through the whole session.\n* It can run interactive line based programs like ftp/telnet/python/ssh/etc including masked password input (pty supported platform only).\n* Since it's a vim buffer you can go into normal mode and move around the buffer, yank, paste, use word completion, etc.\n* Runs on Linux, OS X, Windows, and other UNIX platforms.  Primary development and testing is done on Linux.  Windows has limitations (no interactive programs or Ctrl-C) due to lack of pty support.\n       \nRequirements:\nTo use it you must have a python enabled [g]vim and run on a platform that supports pty (i.e. Linux, OS X),\nor pipes (Windows). The pty version has much better formatted output than the pipes\nversion and supports running interactive programs.  Please read the README for other installation\nand configuration details.  Tested on vim 6.0/7.x using Slackware, Ubuntu, and Gentoo Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, and Windows XP/Vista.  \n\nI'd also like to hear from users running other operating systems, i.e. QNX/Solaris/other BSDs.\n\n!!!!! WINDOWS USERS !!!!!, there is a zip file available at the below link. The version\nkept here on vimonline is a tarred, gzipped file ( tar.gz ). If you are going to use\nWinzip with the .tar.gz file be sure to turn off the \"Tar file smart CR/LF handling\". It doesn't work\nwell.\n\nPlease send me bug reports and suggestions if you use it.  I appreciate all the patches\nI've been getting lately!\n\nVisit:\n\n    http://home.comcast.net/~bsturk/vim.html\n\nSee \"terminal buffer\" for more information.  There is also a (old) screenshot\nof it running on Slackware Linux and Vim 6.0.",

Some apps still\n  will not flush correctly, find(1) for example.\n* Added a help message for SIGINT handler which can be\n  disabled by setting vimsh_show_workaround_msgs\n  to 0 in your .vimrc.  It just explains how to get\n  around not seeing the prompt for commands that don't\n  flush correctly after SIGINT.\n* Go back to insert mode after paging output.\n* Fixes and speed ups for Windows\n      - BufWipeout wasn't being hit so lots of cmd.exe\n        instances being left around, changed to\n        BufDelete.\n      - \n wasn't being removed from end of lines that\n        had it, i.e. ping.exe.\n      - Buffer size for reading from pipe has been\n        optimized somewhat.\n      - Return to insert mode after trying to execute\n        unsupported command.\n      - Changed redraw frequency for better interactive\n        response."
