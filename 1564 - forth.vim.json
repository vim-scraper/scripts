  "description": "This version is an update of the version shipped with Vim 6.X and 7.X. I have only tested it with Vim 7.X.\n\nNew version allows highlighting of \"space errors\" in comments (e.g. trailing spaces and/or tabs). Thanks to Benjamin Krill for this nice feature. To turn it on, add the following line to your vimrc:\n\nlet forth_space_errors=1\n\nIf you have switched it on, you can turn off highlighting of trailing spaces in comments by setting forth_no_trail_space_error in your vimrc. If you do not want the highlighting of a tabulator following a space in comments, you can turn this off by setting forth_no_tab_space_error.\n\n\nComment for the Initial upload:\n\nThomas E. Vaughan send me a patch, to allow words end with a parenthesis. Such a trailing parenthesis will now no longer start the highlighting for stack comments.\n\nI have also added a fix for a bug in the script, that led to an annoying W18 warning while parsing the script. Bill McCarthy and Ilya Sher found that bug in 2004!\nShame on me, I thought I had applied that fix *two* years ago to the offical version.\nWelcome to embarrassment city :-\\",
