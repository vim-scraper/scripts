  "description": "Atom is a theme that was designed to be very readable in both light and dark environments. It concentrates on being easy on the eyes whilst distinguishing different syntax elements.\n\nAll important screenshots can be found at: http://www.gregsexton.org/vim-color-schemes/atom-color/\n\nItalics are not used in this theme. \n\nCurrently Atom is GVim only. I tend to use the default colours when (infrequently) in a terminal. If you have a strong desire for added terminal support leave me a comment, drop me an email or even better: send me a patch!\n\nThere is now a GitHub repository for Atom at: https://github.com/gregsexton/Atom",
