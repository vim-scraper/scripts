  "description": "this (very) lightweight script automatically updates the time-stamp on a file when you :write it out.\nthe time-stamp is of the form:\n     Last Change:  Wed Aug 31 10:00 AM 2005 EDT\n\nThe script is similar to the example given in :help autocmd, the difference being that the time-stamp already there is checked. If it is identical to the one being added, then nothing is done. Since the time-stamp is truncated to the last hour, this ensures that the undo buffer is changed only for :write's every hour.\n\nSet g:timeStampLeader in your ~/.vimrc to change 'Last Change: '\n(to 'Last modified: ' for instance)\n\nUse :NOMOD to force the time-stamp to be not updated.\nUse :MOD to change it back.\n\nPS: The update only works if the string 'Last Change: ' is found somewhere\nin the first 20 lines of the file. Only the first found occurence is processed. \n\nThis is a modified version of lastchange.vim script by Srinath Avadhanula.  This version fixes a bug where if the system was not win32, the time-zone would get truncated from PST to P, or EDT to E, etc.",
