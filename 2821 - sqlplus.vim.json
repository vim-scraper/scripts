  "description": "This file contains routines that may be used to execute SQL queries and describe\ntables from within VIM.  It depends on SQL*Plus.  You must have $ORACLE_HOME\n$ORACLE_SID set in your environment, although you can explicitly set the\ndatabase name to use with the :DB <db-name> command.\n\nIn command mode:\n  <F7>: execute the whole script without applying any changes to it\n  <F8>: execute the SELECT query under your cursor.  The query must begin with\n        the \"select\" keyword and end with a \";\"\n  <Leader><F8>: prompt for an SQL command/query to execute.\n  <F9>: treat the identifier under the cursor as a table name, and do a 'describe'\n        on it.\n  <F10>: prompt for a table to describe.\n  <Leader>sb: open an empty buffer in a new window to enter SQL commands in\n  <Leader>ss: execute the (one-line) query on the current line\n  <Leader>se: execute the query under the cursor (as <F8>)\n  <Leader>st: describe the table under the cursor (as <F9>)\n  <Leader>sc: open the user's common SQL buffer (g:sqlplus_common_buffer) in a\n              new window.\n\n  :Select <...> -- execute the given Select query.\n  :Update <...> -- execute the given Update command.\n  :Delete <...> -- execute the given Delete command\n  :DB <db-name> -- set the database name to <db-name>\n  :SQL <...> -- open a blank SQL buffer in a new window, or if a filename is\n                specified, open the given file in a new window.\n\nIn visual mode:\n  <F8>: execute the selected query\n\nIf queries contain bind variables, you will be prompted to give a value for each\none.  if the value is a string, you must explicitly put quotes around it.  If the\nquery contains an INTO clause, it is removed before executing.\n\nYou will be prompted for your user-name, password and tnsname the first time you access\none of these functions during a session.  After that, your user-id and password\nwill be remembered until the session ends.\n\nThe results of the query/command are displayed in a separate window.\n\nYou can specify the values of the following global variables in your .vimrc\nfile, to alter the behavior of this plugin:\n\n  g:sqlplus_userid -- the user-id to log in to the database as.  If this\n      is specified, g:sqlplus_passwd must be given as well, which is the\n      password to use.  Default: \"\"\n  g:sqlplus_path -- the path the the SQL*Plus executable, including any\n      command line options.  Default: $ORACLE_HOME . \"/bin/sqlplus -s\"\n  g:sqlplus_common_commands -- any SQL*Plus commands that should be\n      executed every time SQL*Plus is invoked.\n      Default: \"set pagesize 10000\\nset wrap off\\nset linesize 9999\\n\"\n  g:sqlplus_common_buffer -- the name of a file that will contain\n      common SQL queries and expressions, that may be opened via the\n      <Leader>sc command.\n  g:sqlplus_db -- the name of the database to connect to.  This variable\n      may also be modified via the :DB command.\n\nAll the honor goes to Jamis Buck \"http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=261&quot; who wrote the  first version \"http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=97&quot; of this script. Unfortunately I can not maintain his original script, so I had to fork it.",
