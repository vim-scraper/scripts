  "description": "If you want 'undofile' only for certain files, you will notice that 'undofile' cannot be set in a modeline, or once the buffer is loaded (because an existing undo file will not be loaded then).  Bram suggests to use a BufReadPre autocmd which sets 'undofile' before the buffer is loaded.  This script does the steps for you.\n\nUsage:\n\n:SetUndoFile[!]\n\n  execute :setlocal undofile, install a BufReadPre autocmd for the current file name and also maintain a plugin file \"plugin/undofile_autocmds.vim\" that enables all such autocmds at next startup of Vim.\n\n  This means you can execute this command once for the current file and then never ever again -- FIRE AND FORGET ;)\n\n  The plugin file (if not found in the runtimepath) is stored in the first directory of the runtimepath (which must contain a \"plugin\" folder).  Older Vims will ignore the plugin.\n\n  With [!], ignore if 'undofile' is already set.\n\n\n:UnsetUndoFile\n\n  opposite of :SetUndoFile.  Does :setlocal noundofile, removes the autcommand and the autcommand entry from \"plugin/undofile_autocmds.vim\"; finally it executes :DelUndoFile.\n\n\n:DelUndoFile\n\n  delete the undofile for the current buffer.  Fails silently.\n\nPLEASE REPORT BUGS",
