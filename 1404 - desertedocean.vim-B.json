This scheme is made for a GUI; terminal colors are still set to the defaults set by the Desert color scheme. I made this scheme using Desert as a starting point and looked to make it have similar qualities with OceanDeep and Zenburn as well. The final result uses mostly a sandy foreground with a fairly high contrast with the greyish blue background.\n\nFeedback is appreciated! I will respond to any questions.\nEmail comments or suggestions to axs221@gmail.com.\nVisit my homepage at http://axs221.1l.com.\n",
