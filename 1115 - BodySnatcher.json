  "description": "if ! has('perl')\n    move along, nothing to see here ;-)\nendif\n\nThis plugin does a search of lines of a .html document and parses the statement of the <body> attributes. In modern times we prefer to use CSS to control presentational aspects of Web pages like text color, background, and link color.  When designing a site from scratch we'd plan that ahead of time. When updating a handful of pages that were not originally authored with CSS in mind, a script like this saves time by pulling out the expected HTML attributes and converting them to CSS declarations.\n\nUpdate 13:07(TZ=EDT) - 28.Oct.2004 -\n   My thanks to the dozen or so people who have downloaded version 1.3, and please update to\nto version 1.4. Important bugs are fixed in this new release.\n\nFor more info and an md5 sum to check against, see this tool's home page at\nhttp://intrepid.perlmonk.org/VIMtools/BSn/index.html",
