  "description": "PowerShell indentation script. Partially relying on the built-in cindent but fixing many PowerShell specific indentations like the comment problem (lines that begin with # were considered precompiler and were never indented) and extraneous indentation after a param() line or a line that ends with a .net function call.\n\nBest used with the Windows PowerShell syntax and ftplugin files (vimscript #1327 and vimscript #1816)\n\nIndentation should be perfect now.\nIf you happen to find anything that does not indent correctly - please comment on my blog post:\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/lior/archive/2009/10/18/powershell-indentation-for-vim-version-2-0.aspx",
