If you're using foldmethod=syntax, there are some nice folds setup by this syntax file.\n\nLatest version always available here:\nhttp://www.markfeeney.com/resources/ihtml.vim",

Setup some autocommands to load ihtml.vim for files ending with ihtml or iht.  Another better strategy is to load the syntax file for any files containing <!iHTML> in the first 2 or three lines of the file.",
