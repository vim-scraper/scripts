When the file it's no new -so it's already created- the plugin checks the 'last modified' field in line number five -if this exists- and then it updates its value. It's my first vim plugin and it's very plain -I beg pardon to vim's gurus for my daring!- I didn't find anything alike, so I had to write my own script. Any correction or modification will be welcome. \n",
