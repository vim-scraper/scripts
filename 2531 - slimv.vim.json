  "summary": "SLIME-like Lisp and Clojure REPL inside Vim with Profiling, Hyperspec, Paredit",
  "name": "slimv.vim",
  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "Slimv tries to mimic a subset of SLIME's (Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs) functionality inside Vim on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The script defines functions and keybindings to send s-expressions to a console mode Lisp or Clojure REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Slimv runs its own REPL or connects to a running REPL started by a previous Slimv session, the connection is established when the first Slimv command is executed (e.g. an s-expression is evaluated).\n\nThe Lisp REPL buffer can also be opened inside Vim as a Vim buffer with syntax highlighting and autoindenting, Lisp commands may be entered in the command line, just as in a regular REPL. The script also has a basic support for Clojure REPL.\n\nSlimv supports the same profiling tool that comes with SLIME. The script also has a Common Lisp Hyperspec lookup feature and it is able to lookup symbols in the Clojure API, as well as in JavaDoc. Symbol name completion is supported via Vim's omni-completion based on the hyperspec symbol database.\n\nSlimv comes with Paredit Mode, which is similar to the functionality of paredit.el in Emacs. Paredit Mode tries to maintain the balanced state of matched characters (parenthesis marks, square brackets, double quotes). Matched characters are inserted and removed in pairs, also when working with a block of text (well, mostly). Slimv also implements many paredit.el s-expression handling functions, like Split/Join/Wrap/Splice. Slurpage and Barfage known from Emacs is also possible but in a different fashion: you don't move the list element in or out of the list, rather you move the opening or closing parenthesis over the element or sub-list.\n\nCheck out the screenshot of Slimv having a clisp REPL buffer:\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/5104/slimvscreenshotx.png\n\nAnother screenshot of Slimv running the Clojure Ants demo:\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/3949/slimvants.png\n\nAnd this is the symbol name completion in action (no, the pink background is not done by Slimv, this is Vim's default):\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/5859/slimvcompl.png\n\nHere follows a list of Slimv commands, any similarity with SLIME's menu is not coincidental. :)\nFor a more complete description with keybindings see the included documentation.\n\nEdit commands:\n    *  Close Form\n    *  Complete Symbol\n    *  Paredit Toggle\n\nEvaluation commands:\n    *  Eval Defun\n    *  Eval Last Expression\n    *  Pprint Eval Last Expression\n    *  Eval Region\n    *  Eval Buffer\n    *  Interactive Eval\n    *  Undefine Function\n\nDebug commands:\n    *  Macroexpand-1\n    *  Macroexpand\n    *  Trace\n    *  Untrace\n    *  Disassemble\n    *  Inspect\n\nCompile commands:\n    *  Compile Defun\n    *  Compile and Load File\n    *  Compile File\n    *  Compile Region\n\nProfile commands:\n    *  Load Profiler\n    *  Profile\n    *  Unprofile\n    *  Unprofile All\n    *  Show Profiled\n    *  Profile Report\n    *  Profile Reset\n\nDocumentation commands:\n    *  Describe Symbol\n    *  Apropos\n    *  Hyperspec\n    *  Generate Tags\n\nREPL commands:\n    *  Connect to Server\n    *  Send Input\n    *  Interrupt Lisp Process\n    *  Close and Send Input\n    *  Previous Input\n    *  Next Input\n\nMany Slimv commands operate on s-expressions or symbols, just like in SLIME. Place the cursor at any location inside the s-expression or on the symbol's name then invoke the command. This builds a command specific form and sends it to the running REPL for evaluation.\n\nFor more information see the documentation coupled with the script, please refer to section \"External Utilities\" for other useful Lisp editing tips not covered by Slimv.",

  "install_details": "Note for users of pre-0.5.0 versions: Slimv is now a Lisp+Clojure filetype plugin, which means that it went through a major reorganization. Please delete the old version before installing the new one. See details in the documentation.\n\nExtract the zip archive into your vimfiles or runtime directory. The archive contains the following files:\n    *  doc/slimv.txt\n    *  ftdetect/clojure.vim\n    *  ftplugin/metering.lisp\n    *  ftplugin/slimv.py\n    *  ftplugin/slimv.vim\n    *  ftplugin/slimv-clhs.vim\n    *  ftplugin/slimv-cljapi.vim\n    *  ftplugin/slimv-javadoc.vim\n    *  ftplugin/clojure/slimv-clojure.vim\n    *  ftplugin/lisp/slimv-lisp.vim\n    *  indent/clojure.vim\n    *  plugin/paredit.vim\n    *  syntax/clojure/slimv-syntax-clojure.vim\n\nSlimv works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X (via Terminal.app), Cygwin is not supported. The script requires the following programs installed on your system:\n    *  Lisp (any console Common Lisp should be OK) or Clojure\n    *  Python 2.4 or later\n    *  Pywin32 is recommended on Windows\nSlimv tries to autodetect your Lisp/Clojure and Python installation directories. If it fails to determine the correct directories, then you need to enter path definitions into your vimrc file:\n    let g:slimv_python = 'C:/MyPythonDir/python.exe'\n    let g:slimv_lisp = 'C:/MyLispDir/mylisp.exe'\n\nShould the autodetection for Clojure fail, set the Lisp path to the complete Clojure REPL startup command, something like:\n    let g:slimv_lisp = '\"java -cp /myclojuredir/clojure.jar clojure.main\"'\n\nLinux users using terminal emulator other than xterm should define the complete command to run the Slimv client + server. Here follows an example with konsole and clisp:\n    let g:slimv_client = 'python ~/.vim/plugin/slimv.py -r \"konsole -T Slimv -e @p @s -l clisp -s\"'\n\nSee the included documentation for more complete installation and customization instructions.",
