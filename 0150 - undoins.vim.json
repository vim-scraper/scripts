  "description": "- Vim provides a number or ways to recover some text that you have deleted\n  (multiple undos, numbered registers, unnamed register etc.), however,\n  there is no way to recover a line or word that you killed either\n  accidentally (e.g., pressing <C-W> one extra time) or deliberately if you\n  are already in insert mode.\n- This little script tries to compensate for this missing functionality for\n  the most commonly used two commands, <C-W> and <C-U> such that the text\n  that is going to be killed is first backed up in an internal script\n  variable before letting Vim continue to do what you asked it to do.\n- The script also provides a mapping (by default <C-X><C-U> which you can\n  customize by using the <Plug>UndoInInsModeUndoKey mapping) that you can\n  execute to put back the text at the current cursor position. A <C-X><C-U>\n  immediately followed by a <C-U> or <C-W> is effectively works like an undo\n  of the previous action.\n- The script is only going to \"estimate\" what is going to be deleted by ^W,\n  but for certain filetypes it may not exactly match the word that Vim is\n  going to delete, in which case the undo might undo too much or too little.\n\n\nThis is essentially a 6.0 version of my previous undoInInsertMode.vim script,\n  except that the script works much better now for ^W, thanks to Luc Hermitte\n  (hermitte at laas dot fr) for helping me get this done.\n\n\nSearch_key_words: undo insert mode undoins undoins.vim Hari Krishna Dara",
