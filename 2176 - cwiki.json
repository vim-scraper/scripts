  "description": "The plugin enhances syntax/folding/mappings of the current buffer, converting it to simple yet useful single-file wiki. Name stands for something like \"compact wiki\".\n\nScreenshot can be downloaded here: http://a-hw.narod.ru/cwiki.png\n\nFeatures:\n=========================\n\n * single file storage (readable textual format; built-in VIM encryption can be applied)\n * unobtrusive wikiwords (no special symbols like brackets)\n * synonyms (you can define them, so \"Bill\", \"William\", and \"Mr. W. Smith\" point to the same article)\n * folding (separates articles; shows number of meaningful article lines)\n * syntax highlighting\n * visual wikiword selector\n\nSyntax:\n=========================\n\nFirst level article title: +++ Wiki word\nSecond level article title: ++++ Wiki word\nThird level article title: +++++ Wiki word\n\nLevel affects folding only, no other side effects.\n\nOptional metadata is expected to be the first non-blank line after the title:\n\n\tSynonyms: a, b, {C,c}def\n\nWhitespace before \"Synonyms\" and after comma is mandatory. Curly braces are expanded like shell patterns, i.e. the line above is equivalent to the following:\n\n\tSynonyms: a, b, Cdef, cdef\n\nActually \"Synonyms\" is the only metadata currently supported.\n\nKey mappings:\n=========================\n\nn_Ctrl-]: follow wikiword under cursor\nv_Ctrl-]: add new article; currently selected text is used as title\nn_F5: refresh the wiki (you need this if you altered synonyms)\nn_F3: show wikiword selector (current wikiword will be highlighted; move cursor to the desired wikiword and press <CR> to select it, or press <F3> to close the selector)\n\nNo other special bindings so far. You can move text around at will. Specifically it is really handy to move whole articles by doing DD and p with folded blocks.\n\nHighlighting groups:\n=========================\n\n * CWikiTitle1, CWikiTitle2, CWikiTitle3: article titles (linked to Title by default).\n * CWikiTitleMark: \"+\" signs in the title (linked to Title by default)\n * CWikiWord: any detected wikiword (linked to Underlined by default)\n\nNotes:\n=========================\n\nAFAIK on Win32 by default Underlined looks like Normal, so you won't be able to see any wikiwords. The following might help:\n\n\t:highlight Underlined gui=underlined\n\nI didn't experience any problems with the plugin yet. But maybe it is a good idea to make backups every now and then (if you do something useful, of course):\n\n\tset backup\n\tset writebackup\n\tau BufWritePre <buffer> let &bex = '-' . strftime(\"%Y%b%d%X\") . '~'\n\nSample:\n=========================\n\nHere is minimal yet complete sample of the wikifile. Just paste it into new buffer and type :set ft=cwiki (after installing the plugin, of course).\n\n--8<------------------------------\n+++ First article\n\n    Synonyms: 1st article, {A,a}rticle #1\n\nHere we have some text. I'd like to mention Mr. W.\nSmith (note that his name is wrapped with <CR>).\n\n+++ Mr. W. Smith\n\n    Synonyms: William, Bill, dad\n\nThis article is about Mr. W. Smith, also known as\nWilliam, Bill. He has two doughters: Jane and Kim.\n\nArticle #1 mentions Bill. Though, that 1st article\nis rather short.\n\n++++ Jane Smith\n\n    Synonyms: Jane\n\nMs. Jane's dad is Bill.\n\n++++ Kim\n\nKim is too young, so we refer to her without the last\nname, e.g. no synonyms yet. She loves her dad.\n--8<------------------------------",
