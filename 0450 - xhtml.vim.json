  "description": "This script creates shortcuts for most xhtml tags, and in gvim it adds a menu for the various tags.  Shortcuts are triggered by the semicolon.  For example ;li will create open and close \"list item\" tags and leave the cursor between them.  Similarly ;im creates an image tag and leaves the cursor in the first field.\n\nCtrl-J is bound to a kind of \"jump\" and will generally place the cursor at the next place you would want to type (the next field or the place just before the next tag starts).\n\nThere are bindings for the 3 modes; command mode, insert mode, and visual mode; as well as some special characters like ;cp (copyright symbol) and ;< (less than symbol).",
