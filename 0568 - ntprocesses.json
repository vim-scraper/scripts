  "description": "PLEASE READ THE INSTALL SECTION COMPLETELY.\n\n- This plugin generates a list of NT processes that are running on the\n  local NT/W2K/XP machine. You can kill any by processing K on the\n  corresponding entry.\n- You can open the processlist window through WinManager (as described in\n  the installation section below) or by assigning a hot key. You can use\n  the same hot key to open/close the window. Alternatively, you can also\n  use the :NTProcesses command to open/close the processes window.\n- You can choose which fields that you want to see by using the\n  NtpFields command. You can select the sort fields by pressing s\n  consecutively and r for reversing the sort direction.\n- If you have permissions, you can view the process list in a remote m/c\n  by using the NtpSetHost command. With no arguments, it prints the\n  current remote host name. To switch back to the local m/c, use \".\" for\n  the host name.\n- For the sake of speed, the list of processes is cached. To see the\n  latest set of processes and their states at any time, refresh the window\n  by pressing 'R'.\n- It requires multvals and genutils plugins to be always installed, but\n  others are required only depending on your usage/setting (for a better\n  experience and formatting).\n\n\nSearch_key_words: ntprocesses ntprocess NT processes process kill multvals genutils align Hari Krishna Dara ",
  "install_details": "- Place the plugin in a plugin diretory under runtimepath and configure\n  WinManager according to your taste. E.g:\n                                                                           \n    let g:winManagerWindowLayout = 'FileExplorer,NTProcesses'\n                                                                           \n  You can then switch between FileExplorer and NTProcesses by pressing ^N\n  and ^P.\n- If you don't want to use WinManager, you can still use the :NTProcesses\n  comamnd or assign a hotkey by placing the following in your vimrc:\n                                                                           \n    nmap <silent> <F6> <Plug>NTProcesses\n                                                                           \n  You can substitute any key or sequnce of keys for <F6> in the above map.\n- Requires multvals.vim to be installed. Download from:\n    http://www.vim.org/script.php?script_id=171\n- Requires genutils.vim to be installed. Download from:\n    http://www.vim.org/script.php?script_id=197\n- If Align.vim is installed, it is used to format the output.\n- Requires cscript.exe to be in the path.\n- Use g:ntprocFields, g:ntprocSortFieldIndex, g:ntprocSortDirection to\n  specify field names, default sort field and the sort direction\n  respectively. Use NtpFields command to see the list of field names\n  possible.\n",
