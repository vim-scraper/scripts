  "description": "\"   This script has been created as a means to hopefully make using\n\"   cygwin easier, so that scripts that utilize *nix commands can be\n\"   ported to windows.\n\"\n\"   Right now this script provides only a few funtions, but it may grow\n\"   over time.\n\"\n\"   I'm making sure that each function will be safe to use under *nix\n\"   (specifically linux, since that's what I use) by confirming that vim\n\"   is running under windows before executing any windows/cygwin\n\"   specific commands.\n\"\n\" Platform:\n\"   Windows:\n\"     Requires cygwin (http://cygwin.com).\n\"   *nux:\n\"     Should be safe to use any function defined within on *nix systems\n\"     since each function checks the platform before running system\n\"     specific commands.\n\"\n\"     However, if you don't want *nix users to have a dependency on this\n\"     plugin, you may define proxy functions that first check if a function\n\"     is defined before using it.\n\"\n\"     Ex. Defining a proxy function for translating paths based on OS.\n\"       function! s:DeterminePath (path)\n\"         if exists(\"*CygwinPath\")\n\"           return CygwinPath(a:path)\n\"         endif\n\"         return a:path\n\"       endfunction\n\"\n\" Configuration:\n\"   Note: Configuration is only necessary on Windows machines.\n\"\n\"   g:CygwinHome\n\"     Set this to the location of your cygwin installation dir.\n\"     Ex.\n\"       let g:CygwinHome = 'c:/cygwin'\n\"     Note: Be careful using '\\&#039 in double quoted strings since\n\"     that represents the start of an escape character in vim.\n\"\n\"   On windows you will need to add your cygwin/bin directory to\n\"   your WINDOWS path.\n\"     PATH=%CYGWIN_HOME%\\bin;%PATH%\n\"   So that unix commands can be executed from your dos console.\n\"\n\"   Also, I had issues using Windows' default temp directory.\n\"   Vim continually had issues accessing temp files (that I have\n\"   no control over).  It seems it was due to the spaces in the\n\"   directory path, so I changed my system %TMP% and %TEMP%\n\"   variables to point to c:\\cygwin\\tmp instead, and that solved\n\"   my issues.  You may have to do the same.\n\"\n\" Limitations:\n\"   All file and directory paths used in cygwin commands need to\n\"   be absolute.  When the vim shell is set to a cygwin shell, the\n\"   shell defaults to executing in the user's home directory.\n\"   Because of this, relative paths cannot be used.\n",
