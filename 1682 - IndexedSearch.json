  "description": "\" This plugin redefines 6 search commands (/,?,n,N,*,#). At every\n\" search command, it automatically prints\n\"        \"At match #N out of M matches\".\n\" -- the total number of matches (M) and the number(index) of current\n\" match (N). This helps to get oriented when searching forward and\n\" backward.\n\"\n\" To try out the plugin, source it and play with N,n,*,#,/,? commands.\n\" There are no new commands and no new behavior to learn. \n\" Just watch the bottom line when you do /,?,n,N,*,#.\n\"\n\" Works on vim6 and vim7.  Won't cause slowdown\n\" on very large files (but then counters are not displayed).\n\"\n\" -----------------------------------------------------\n\" Checking At which Match Number You Are\n\" .....................................................\n\" You can press g/ or \\\\ or \\/ (that's backslach then slash),to show \n\" at which match index you are, without moving the cursor.\n\" Messages are:\n\"     At Nth match of M (if cursor is exactly on the match)\n\"     Betwen matches N1-N2 of M (if cursor is between matches)\n\"     At single match\n\"     Before first match, of N\n\"     After last match, of N\n\" Command  ':ShowSearchIndex'  shows same information.\n\" ------------------------------------------------------\n\" To disable colors for messages, set 'let g:indexed_search_colors=0'.\n\" ------------------------------------------------------\n\" Performance.     Plugin bypasses the calculation of match index when \n\" it would take too much time (too many matches, too large file). You can\n\" tune performance limits, look into script sources after comment \n\" \"Performance tuning limits\".\n\" ------------------------------------------------------\n\" In case of bugs and wishes, please email to:  \n\" iler.ml at gmail.com\n\" ------------------------------------------------------\n\" To show slightly shorter messages, define 'let g:indexed_search_shortmess=1'\n",
