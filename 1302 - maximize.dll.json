Everything always works fullscreen on my computer, and Vim is the core part of my work, so I maximized its window by hands each time, and searched for an automated solution.\n\n\nDetails:\n\nThis can be done by a DLL, which must be called with libcallnr() function:\n\n    call libcallnr('maximize', 'Maximize', 1)\n\nIt takes one numeric parameter: 1 means maximize the window and 0 restores it back. It returns 1 on success, 0 on fault.\n\n\nZIP archive is 4.4 Kb.\nSource inside.",
  "install_details": "Put maximize.vim and maximize.dll in $VIM\\vimfiles\\plugin\n\nFor Cream, you will also have to write:\n    let g:CREAM_WINPOS=0\nin your cream-conf.vim",
