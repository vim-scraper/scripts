For Clojure(-Contrib) head consider using the\nbleeding-edge branch from the repository.\n\nThe Ivy configuration will fetch an known-to-work\nClojure(-Contrib) version. For manual compilation,\nyou have to care for that yourself. A compiled jar\nis already included in the distribution in the build\nsubdirectory.\n\nChanges since v2.1.1:\n\n* Fixed a regression of qualified keywords highlighting\n* Fixed a infinite loop if there is no prompt in the Repl buffer\n* Made compilation of ng client a bit more comfortable\n* Added library configuration for OpenSolaris (thanks to Richard Newman)\n* Changed normal invokations to ignore keymappings (reported by James Reeves)\n* Fixed typo in lispwords: defmethod -> defmulti\n* Added letfn to lispwords\n* Added c.c.def/defnk to lispwords\n* Added #_ and #! as comment indicators to syntax highlighting\n  (currently only the #_ is marked as comment, the following form\n  is still highlighted normally.)\n* Fixed annoying o/O delay bug\n* Simplified plugin installation"
