  "description": "This file is useful with gcc and other programs run from make, when these tools come from Cygwin and the version of Vim used is the win32 native version.\nIn other environments, Vim default settings are perfect.\n\nReason: the filenames (for whom gcc reports errors) are expressed in the UNIX form, and Vim is unable to open them from the quickfix window. Hence the filtering used to replace '/' (root) by {cygpath -m /}.\nSince the version 20040616, this plugin is also able to follow symbolic links -- defined from cygwin.\n\nAt this time, it has only be tested with gcc, but I guess it should be useful with other compilers built for cygwin.\n\n\nImprovments are certainly posible. Any feedback is welcomed!",
