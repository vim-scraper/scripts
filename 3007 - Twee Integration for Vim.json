  "description": "This adds syntax highlighting and compiler support for twee files (*.tw).\nThe syntax highlighting was prepared with a dark colorscheme in mind.\n\nTyping :make in .tw files will run twee (1.7.5) on them and pipe it to an html file named as the current file. That is, running :make on fiction.tw will create the fiction.html file.\n\nTwee (http://gimcrackd.com/etc/src/) is an interactive stories creation tool based on TyddlyWiki, developed by Chris Klimas.",
