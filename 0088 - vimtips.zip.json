You must download the tips separately, from\nhttp://vim.sourceforge.net/tips/tip_download.php\n\n    After installation, you can get the next tip with\n\n:TipOfTheDay\n\n(usual abbreviation rules apply) or go to the top of the tips file with\n\n:help vimtips.txt",

  "install_details": "1. Unpack totd.zip into a directory in your |runtimepath|.  For most users,\nthis typically means ~/.vim or $HOME/vimfiles or $VIM/vimfiles .  This will\ncreate files\n\tplugin/totd.vim\t(the plugin)\n\tdoc/totd.txt\t(the docs)\n\tplugin/vimtips/vimtips.txt\t(skeleton tips file)\n\n2a. The easiest thing may be to restart vim, either right now or whenever you\nget around to it.  Then totd.vim will automatically run |:helptags|, edit the\ntags file, and open the skeleton vimtips file.\n\n2b. If you want to finish the installation right now, without restarting vim,\nsimply source the totd.vim file and get a tip:\n\n\t:source path/to/totd.vim\n\t:TipOfTheDay\n\n3. The totd.vim plugin will open the skeleton vimtips file in a help window.\nFollow the URL there to download a real vimtips file.\n\n4. As with any plugin that comes with documentation, you should run\n\n\t:helptags path/to/doc\n\nso that you can read the documentation with\n\n\t:help totd\n\t:help Tip",
