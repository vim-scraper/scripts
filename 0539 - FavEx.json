  "description": "favex.vim is a plugin to update a list (favlist) of favorite files and directories, and use the list to provide easy access to the favorites. \n\nA skeletal favlist is provided. As you edit your favorites, you can add files and their directories to favlist with the :FF and :FD commands or their \\ff and \\fd key map equivalents. Once there are some entries in favlist, you can access your favorites by entering a favex window with either :FE or :FS and then pressing <Enter>, o, or O -- keys entirely analogous to those used in file-explorer. The key mappings, the favex window height, and the favex directory explore command can be customized by setting global variables in your vimrc.\n\nfavex.vim requires Vim 6.0 (or later) run with at least \"set nocompatible\" in the vimrc, and with the standard file-explorer plugin (or a suitable replacement) loaded.",
  "install_details": "1. Unzip favex.zip, preserving directory structure, into either\n$HOME/.vim for unix or $HOME\\vimfiles for MSWindows. \n2. Start Vim\n3. Do\n:helptags ~/.vim/doc (for unix)\nor\n:helptags ~\\vimfiles\\doc (for MSWindows)\n4. Do :help favex to learn about usage and customization.",
