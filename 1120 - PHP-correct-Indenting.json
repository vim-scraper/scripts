  "description": "(The version 1.23 of this script is already included in VIM 7)\n\nFeatures:\n- Indent \"perfectly\" PHP code.\n- Comment or non-PHP code doesn't break the algorithm.\n- Non-PHP code, multiline /**/ comments and \"Here Document\" content remain unchanged.\n- HTML <Script.*> tags are indented as PHP and like if their content was part of the surrounding PHP code.\n- Fast optimized indenting, the script knows when it's indenting large blocks and skips some unnecessary tests...\n- Support folding (folds don't break the indenting)\n- Auto-formatting for comments (using the Vim option formatoptions=qroc).\n- Indent correctly complex \"non bracketted blocks\" (like in language C):\n\n    Example: (start of line spaces are replaced by ____)\n<?php\nif (!isset($History_lst_sel)) \n____if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) \n________if (!isset($History_lst_sel)) {\n____________$History_lst_sel=0;\n________} else\n____________$foo=\"truc\";\n____else\n_______$bla= \"foo\";\n$command_hist = TRUE;\n?>\n\n- Direct indenting, the text is indented as you type it.\n- switch/case are indented correctly.\n- Script source code well commented.\n- Bug free as far as I know :)\n\nA more complete example of its capabilities:\n\n<?php\nif ($foo=\"thing\") // as you see an opened bracket isn't needed to indent correctly :)\n____if (foo(\"something\"))\n____{\n________somethingelse(\"blabla\");\n?>\n\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>SOME HTML CODE</title>\n<?\n________echo \"Something here\";\n?>\n________<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n________// Note the indentation of the script as if part of PHP\n\n________var truc=0;\n________if (truc) {\n____________nothing();\n________}\n\n________</script>\n\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<b>some closing and oppenning bracket here } } {\nnothing to indent here :)\n</b>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n<?\n________Somethingelse(true);\n____}\n\nif (foo)\n____/* a useless comment here\n____with useless code:\n____if (broken code) {\n___________________blabla();\n____*/\n____if (testHereDocument()) {\n\n\n________echo <<<HEREDOC\nHere is an Here Document style\necho, very useful.\nThe following code isn't indented\nif (test)\nwhile (foo) {\nnothing();\n}\nHEREDOC;\n\n____}\n\nbye();\n?>\n\nThat's all folks!\n\nThis script can also be found there: (with colorful examples)\nhttp://www.2072productions.com/?to=phpindent.txt\n\nThere is also a newsletter where you can subscribe at:\nhttp://www.2072productions.com/?to=php-indent-for-vim-newsletter.php\n(only about new releases of this script)\n\nEnjoy :)\n",

      "release_notes": "- Added support for \"Here document\" tags: \n-   HereDoc end tag are indented properly. \n-   HereDoc content remain unchanged. \n- All the code that is outside PHP delimiter remains unchanged. \n- New feature: The content of <script.*> html tag is considered as PHP and indented according to the surrounding PHP code. \n- \"else if\" are detected as \"elseif\". \n- Multiline /**/ are indented when the user type it but remain unchanged when indenting from their beginning. \n- Fixed indenting of // and # comments. \n- php_sync_method option is set to 0 (fromstart). This is required for complex php script else the indent may fail. \n- Files with non PHP code at the beginning could alter the indent of the following PHP code. \n- Other minor improvments and corrections."
