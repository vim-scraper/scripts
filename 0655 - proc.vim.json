You can get the same functionality with esqlc.vim in the standard distribution.\n\nThis is a start towards a customization of the C++ syntax, for code that uses the Oracle Pro*C/C++ precompiler code.  Essentially it loads up the C++ syntax file, and then does additional highlighting of text that begins with EXEC SQL.\n\n",
