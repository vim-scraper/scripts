  "description": "This is a simple syntax file to color columns in NoSQL tables. It's a rather\nheavily modified version of the VimOutliner syntax file. Currently it supports\nup to 16 columns. If you need more than that, you can always tweak the file.\n\nSince NoSQL tables are just TSV (tab-separated) tables, this syntax file will work on any \nTSV table you like. \n\nIf you don't favor NoSQL, you can access TSV tables in perl, e.g., using\nthe DBI module and DBI::AnyData. For example, to access a list of photos:\n\nour $fphotos = \"photos.tsv\";\n\nour $pdbh = DBI->connect('dbi:AnyData(RaiseError=>1):');\n\n$pdbh->func( 'photos', 'Tab', \"$fphotos\", 'ad_catalog' );\n\nNote that you'll need to remove the ^A characters in the header line to access a NoSQL table \nwith DBI like this. That's the only difference I've noted.\n\nFuture versions of nosql.vim might include helpful mappings for navigation, deleting\ncolumns, and so on, as well as syntax highlighting for NoSQL lists and templates.\n\nNoSQL, of course, is a delightful and free collection of scripts that can\nturn flat text files into databases. Instead of locking your data in binary\nand slogging through phpMyAdmin, you can open your tables in Vim, \nedit your data with your usual Vim flair, and then save your queries and\nreports as shell scripts. If you don't yet have NoSQL installed, check out the\nRESOURCES in the help file.\n\nNoSQL homepage: http://www.scriptaworks.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi/NoSQL/HomePage?from=NoSQL.NoSQL\n\nnosql.vim homepage: Coming soon. :)",
