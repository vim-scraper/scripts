Some times depending on the type of editing being done it is useful to have different status lines.\n\nSee the comments in the file to see how to setup the status lines. Two status lines are already provided. Can configure in the script or in the .vimrc file.\n\n<Leader>r is the default mapping to effect a single rotation. To cycle through all statuslines/rulers keep using <Leader>r.",
