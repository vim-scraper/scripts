  "description": "This script redefines the % motion so that (in addition to its usual behavior)\nit cycles through if/elif/else, try/except/catch, for/continue/break, and\nwhile/continue/break structures.  The script also\ndefines g% to cycle in the opposite direction.  Two other motions, [% and ]%,\ngo to the start and end of the current block, respectively.\n\nAll of these motions should work in Normal, Visual, and Operator-pending\nmodes.  For example, d]% should delete (characterwise) until the end of the\ncurrent block; v]%d should do the same, going through Visual mode so that\nyou can see what is being deleted; and V]%d makes it linewise.",

For example, [% and ]% now accept a count,  `` goes back to where you started, and g% does nothing (insteadof acting like the default %) if the cursor starts on a line that does not begin with a recognized key word."
