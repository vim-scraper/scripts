  "description": "Tumble for vim\n==============\n\nThis script adds to vim the ability to send text entries to the tumblr.com\nblogging platform. It supports markdown formatting, and is able to edit and\ndelete previous entries.\n\nIn order to work, the variables\n\ntumblr_email\ntumblr_password\ntumblr_tumblelog\n\nmust be set. They are evaluated on every command, so you can change them on\nthe fly in case you need to switch to another blog.\n\ntumble.vim adds three commands to Vim:\n\n:Tumble\n:TumbleLink\n:ListTumbles\n\nThe syntax for :Tumble is\n\n:[range]Tumble [draft|publish]\n\nBy default, it posts the entire current buffer to tumblr.com, but a range can\nbe supplied if that isn't desired. For example, \":,Tumble\" would post the\ncurrent selection.\n\nUnless 'draft' (sans ') is given as an argument, it publishes the post\nimmediately. The default behaviour is equivalent to \":Tumble publish\". Any\nother argument could make the posting to fail. tumble.vim doesn't have safety\nmeasures against that currently.\n\nWhenever it can, tumble.vim tries to be smart. If it finds a first level setext\nstyle markdown title in the first lines of the buffer or range, it detects it\nas a title. If the title is found to be the same as the one from an earlier\npost, it overwrites it, instead of sending a new post.\n\nThe syntax for :TumbleLink is\n\n:[range]TumbleLink\n\nIt assumes the [range] is formatted thus:\n\nline\n1 URL\n2 NAME\n3... DESCRIPTION\n\nNAME and DESCRIPTION are optional, but NAME should always be on line 2 (so if you don't want to give a name to the link, you should keep this line blank).\n\nThe syntax for :ListTumbles is\n\n:ListTumbles draft|published\n\nIt prints a list of your published or drafting posts in the current buffer. If you\npress <enter> over a post line, tumble.vim will try to fetch the post and load it\nfor editing. If you press <delete>, it will delete the post.\n\nThe original version was based on Travis Jeffery's tumblr.vim\n(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2329), and the current version\ncontains some ideas from it.\n\nFelipe Morales\nhel.sheep@gmail.com",
