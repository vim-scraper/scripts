It began as a fork of the largely outdated VIP (formerly PDV), but has morphed into it's own project. While the file is located here, development happens on github. http://github.com/spf13/PIV.\n\nIt does not include non PHP specific functionality like commenting but rather suggests you use one of the many general purpose plugins that do a great job.. Recommendations provided at the end of this doc.\n\nFeatures\n\nSyntax updated for PHP 5.3\n\nThe list of PHP constants, functions, and classes was updated to be current with PHP 5.3.
