  "description": "Contains several mappings (about 30) to save typing when Java programming.  Most are short for keywords, types, etc.  (e.g. ,p ,s ,f ^Ts  -->  public static final String).  Some are more complex, like inserting a javadoc comment or expanding a constructor.\n\nThe script is commented sufficiently.\n\nI haven't added anything to this for ages, but there is no limit to how useful this can be, so please feel free to add updates.",
