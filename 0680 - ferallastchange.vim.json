  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "Update the last modification time of the file if an appropriate string is found in the first 20 lines of the file.\n\nThis is a fork of lastchange.vim and is based On Srinath Avadhanula's <email in file> work in lastchange.vim (v1.0 dated Sat Mar 30 04:00 PM 2002 PST; VIMSCRIPT #259)\n\n\nChanges: From lastchange.vim v1.0\n\nThis is now an almost proper vim60 plugin.\n\nTime stamp can be defined by setting g:flastchangetimeformat to the desired string for strftime().\n\nExample: (from my .vimrc)\n\" [Feral:166/03@13:11] How I like ferallastchange.vim setup\nlet g:flastchangeleader = '\\\\date\\t\\t'\n\" Condense `Pacific Daylight Time` into `PDT` and tack that onto the end of our\n\"\ttime stamp format string\nlet g:flastchangetimeformat = '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M '.substitute(strftime('%Z'), '\\<\\(\\w\\)\\(\\w*\\)\\>\\(\\W\\|$\\)', '\\1', 'g')\n\nNOTE how format %Z is special cased and replaced with a shortened string. I.e. `Pacific Daylight Time` becomes `PDT`. This is also done in the default time format string.\n\nSlightly more robust checking to see if we should operate; to speed up writing when we have nothing to do or can't do anything, etc.;\n\n\nSimplified and fixed, (then removed altogether) RemoveLastHistoryItem(); (could muck up search pattern)\n\nRemed out :MOD and :NOMOD commands; I have never used them; Just unrem if wanted...\n\n:sub method remed; Currently uses a setline, hopefully more efficient.\n\nLimitation:\nThe search to find the timestamp messes with the jumplist; I do not want it to; will fix when I know how!\nUpdating the timestamp is part of undo, thus you have to undo twice after a :w (Once to undo the timestamp and again to undo whatever it is you wanted to undo.)\n\nNOTE: v1.1 (initial; no longer available) had a FATAL boo boo in my attempt to\nget the timestamp updating out of undo. It changes undolevels to -1 (and then\nsets it back to what it was), this has the undesired effect of flushing your\nundo information for the file when ever you write. NOT at all what I had\nintended. If you use v1.1 now, please update to v1.2 ASAP. My sincere apologies\nfor any work lost as the result of this bungle.",
