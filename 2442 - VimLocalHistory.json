This provides a convenient, automatic backup system of, e.g. files in /etc that are modified, as well as a poor man's \"local history\" (a l√° the eclipse feature with the same name).\n\nFeedback, bug reports and suggestions gratefully accepted at <vlh@hjdivad.com>.\n\n\nTo use, install, configure g:vlh_repository_dir and then use vim normally.  Every time you write a buffer whose path is on the local filesystem, a copy is saved in a git repository.\n\nYou can open, diff or restore older versions of files with the commands VLHOpen, VLHDiff and VLHReplace.\n\nsource code is available from github at http://github.com/hjdivad/vimlocalhistory/tree/master",
  "install_details": "To install from a tarball:\n\n\tAfter ensuring that you meet the requirements, copy the contents of\n\tplugin to user-specific vim plugin directory, probably ~/.vim/plugin/\n\n\tTo install documentation, copy README (this file) to your vim\n\tdocumentations directory, such as ~/.vim/doc/vlh.txt.  After copying\n\tthe documentation, execute \":helptags ~/.vim/doc\" from within vim to\n\tmake the documentation accessible.\n\nTo install from source:\n\n\tInstall the requirements, additionally installing rake version 0.8.1\n\tor higher, and then execute\n\n\t\trake install\n\n\twhich will install the plugin and documentation.\n\n\nOnce VLH is installed, make sure to edit your ~/.vimrc to include\n\n\tlet g:vlh_repository_dir = \"/path/where/youd/like/to/store/localhistory\"\n\nI suggest using ~/.vim/localhistory.\n\n",
