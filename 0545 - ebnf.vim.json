  "description": "Syntax file for EBNF as specified by ISO/IEC 14977 : 1996(E)\n\nEBNF is slightly different from most homegrown BNF.  Terminals are always quoted, non-terminals are not (and may contain spaces). Kleene closure is achieved by enclosing with braces, 0-or-1 matches with brackets, 1-or-more matches by appending \"-\" to the end of the braces (i.e. {one non-terminal, second non-terminal}- ). Atoms are separated by \",\" or \"|\". A production rule ends with \";\" or \".\". Comments are (* comment *)\n\nFor more information on EBNF see http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-ebnf.html",
