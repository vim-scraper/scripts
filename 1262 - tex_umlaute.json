Some write {\\\"a}, some \\\"a, some \\\"{a} some even \"a.\n\nOn loading all occurances of TeX encoded German Umlauts will be replaced by their normal counterparts. On writing they are replaced by a clean standard encoding (\\\"a for an ä, \\ss{} for ß).\n\nCan be simply extended for other chars or utf-8 codings if there is need for...",
