  "description": "This plugin provides a simple file browser. It is not a full blown \nexplorer but can be nevertheless be useful for quickly selecting a few \nfiles or renaming them.\n\nAs the plugin does some caching in the background, the filelist is only \ngenerated once for each path or when called with [!]. In conjuncture \nwith the use of the [wbg]:tselectfile_filter_rx variable, this provides \nfor use as a simple ad-hoc project manager.\n\nVIM-CENTRIC EXAMPLE:\nWhen I open a file under \"~/vimfiles\", I set b:tselectfiles_dir \nto all the relevant directories under \"~/vimfiles\" and then set \nb:tselectfile_filter_rx = expand('%:t:r'). Thus, when I open \n\"~/vimfiles/plugin/foo.vim\", b:tselectfile_filter_rx is \"foo\", and \n:TSelectFiles shows all the files under \"~/vimfiles\" matching \"foo\".\n\nFeatures:\n    - list files (recursively or the in the current directory only), \n      dynamically select files matching a pattern\n    - open files\n    - preview files\n    - rename/move files\n    - batch rename/move files (using a regular expression)\n    - copy files\n    - delete files\n    - show file info\n\nAdvanced uses:\n\nRelated files: If you set |g:tselectfiles_filter_rx| to some appropriate \nvalue, only files matching that regexp will be shown initially. This can \nbe used to restrict the list to \"related\" files. (The initial filter can \nbe removed by pressing <c-bs>.) See also |tselectfiles#BaseFilter()| and \n|g:tselectfiles_part_subst|.\n\nRolodex: If a filename matches an entry in \n|g:tselectfiles_filedescription_rx| (a dictionnary patter => funcref), \nfuncref(filename) will be called to retrieve the file's description. \nThis function could be used to extract metadata or selected lines from \nthe file etc. By mapping one record onto one file, you would get some \nsort of rolodex-like database. See \n|tselectfiles#FormatVikiMetaDataOrFirstLine()| for an example for \nviki/deplate (vimscript #861) formatted files.\n",
