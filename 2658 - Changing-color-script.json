  "description": "Tested and works well with Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, ActionScript (with 'actionscript.vim', available elsewhere in Vim.org), AutoIt and AutoHotKey.  Gradually changes changing syntax colours over the hour.\n\nBenefits:\n+ reduces user 'freezing' symptoms\n+ improves space/time-awareness\n+ recruits right side of brain brain cells\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Under Windows GUI resources are wasted over time due to how VIM changes colors\n- Off-putting flicker occurs when color changes\n\nOnly affects GVIM. Nothing happens in VIM.\n\n",
