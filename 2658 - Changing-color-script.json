Gradually changes changing syntax colours over the hour. Works well with time script to speech script: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3257\n\nBenefits of script are:\n* reduce eye-strain and headaches caused by staring at code on-screen\n* reduce dis-orientation by keeping user informed of passing time\n* reduce boredom by stimulating right side of the brain\n\nOnly affects GVIM. Nothing happens in VIM.",

This not only causes a flash/beep and the timer not to work (hence no automatic colour changes) but also when you try moving off this line it could go funny (the cursor mysteriously jumps up a line) but it's nothing serious."

There is a slight possibility that the editor will beep at you if you are on the first character or if there are no characters in the file, but hopefully that should not be the case long enough to bother. Also added a line set whichwrap=h,l to minimise this flashing. If you like using this script it is better to leave this on as it will minimise this flashing/beeping."

Other elements can have their backgrounds \"fixed-up\" using various tricks to correct their visibility but Normal can't. Typically Normal is the keywords and most of the variable names in Javascript. Other languages rely on it to a lesser degree, but still can be quite heavily dependent on it. The better supported languages (like PHP) rely on it a lot less. Anyway, if you use Changing Colour script now Normal doesn't stand-out glaring too much but while still remaining visible at both bright and dark backgrounds. It's quite a subtle compromise between glare and visibility this one and i hope i got it right."
