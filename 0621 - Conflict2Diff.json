  "description": "This plugin splits a CVS conflict file into three diff windows.  The 2 conflicting versions of the file are put on the left and right.  The central window contains the file, with each conflicting area replaced by \"=======\".  Buffer specific mappings are set up to make the merging simple:\n\n<Ctrl-Down> Move to the next conflict\n<Ctrl-Up> Move to the previous conflict\n<Ctrl-Left> Use the text from the lefthand file for this conflicting area\n<Ctrl-Right> Use the text from the righthand file for this conflicting area\n<Ctrl-q> Finish by closing the left and righthand windows, turning off diff and removing the mappings\n",
