It recognizes the entire set of MIPS instructions and directives, as well as all registers (be they aliased ($s0), directly numerical ($16), or an FP register ($f0)), correct MIPS comment style, and label declarations.\n\nIf you have any problems, I invite you to contact me and report them.  Enjoy!",
