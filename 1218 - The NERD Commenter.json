Now if a filetype has alternative delims, the\n  script will check whether an option of the form\n  \"NERD_<&filetype>_alt_style\" exists, and if it does then alt delims will\n  be used. See |NERD_com-cust-delims| for details.\n- The script no longer removes extra spaces for sexy comments for the\n  NERDRemoveExtraSpaces option (it will still remove spaces if\n  NERDSpaceDelims is set).\n- Added dummy support for viminfo and rtf.\n- Added support for the \"gentoo-package-\\(keywords\\|mask\\|use\\)\"\n  filetypes.\n- Added '#' comments as an alternative for the asm filetype\n\nThanks to Markus Klinik and Anders for bug reports, and again to Anders\nfor his patch. Thanks to John O'Shea and fREW for the filetype\ninformation.\n"
