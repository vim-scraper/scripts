  "description": "Normal VIM lets you center the file based on the current cursor position when you press zz, zt and zb.  This is nice but wouldn't it be nicer if this centering took place smoothly, like panning across a scene of a movie.  This script tries to give you this.  Use Esc, SHIFT-Esc and SHIFT-F1 respectively for zz, zt and zb.  You can cancel this 'smooth centering' by pressing Esc again.   Script now correctly accounts for 'scrolloff' setting being non-zero, as it should.  Please leave a comment :) For a truly immersing experience try this too: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2658.  Note: you may not see anything if your updatetime  is to a default vim value like 4000 because it is too high.  With this rate it will take 4 seconds for each 'center' step.",
  "install_details": "Add to your _vimrc file. Works best with a lower setting for updatetime, I use 650. The more you have it the longer it takes before the screen scrolls, but be careful not to decrease updatetime too much.",

Not sure why but fixed it and checked it so that this does not happen.  Had a bug that caused the continuing of scrolling when line wrapping was on. This gave incorrect readings for the window height so that scrolling would continue.  Fixed this by putting in a check that warns you if wrap is on, and doesn't scroll."

If you were at the top of bottom having done S-ESC or S-F1 with scrolloff>0 then the display would stop scrolling then, but then later on when you moved off that line the display would keep on trying to scroll. This was to do with where I had attempted to account for the 'scrolloff' value in the centering bit of my code.  Made the command line clear so that you don't see a silly 'call StartSmoothCentering()' at the bottom of the screen each time."

Now correctly identifies the scrolloff setting and accounts for this value, not just the cursors position within the current window.  Changed key mappings to be a more natural-feeling S-ESC gets you 'out of the code', in other words lets you see where you are by scrolling the file down, whereas S-F1 scrolls up and hence further deep into the file."
