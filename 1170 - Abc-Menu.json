  "description": "Abc-Menu installs some more menu-Items for easier access and \nremembering.\n\nvim is a very powerfull editor with tons of functions and even \nmore documentation. I always found new functions and i was looking\nfor a way to search them quickly. index.txt was my friend so far :)\n\nSometime I have my little daughter laying in my arm and I have only \none hand for writing. In this case, some functions of vim are very hard\nto reach.\n\nThis file helps me in both cases.\nI made an alphabetical menu for some of the functions for the normal mode.\nThe reason for strict alphabetical order  is to make using the menu\nlike typing the commands and help to remember to type the command next time \nor to be able to use another vim on another maching without this special menu.\n\nThere are some special sub-menus\n i = shift\n k = control\n l = alt\nI think ijkl are keys that everyone knows. You won't find them in the Abc-Menu.\n\nExample for using the menu:\nIf you want to reach all commands in Normal mode with Uppercase characters\ntype following keys:\n  alt      invoke menu  (or alt-n together)\n    n      normal-Mode commands\n     i    shift-commands \n\nLook at the bottom of the screen. Every command has a little tip. I took most\ntips from index.txt.\n\ntested with gvim 6.2, windows XP\nKnoppix 3.7: the tips are missing,  Hotkey only in left textarea possible\n \nScreenshots:\nhttp://jochen-behrens.de/vim/vim-menu-g.png\nhttp://jochen-behrens.de/vim/vim-menu-n.png",
