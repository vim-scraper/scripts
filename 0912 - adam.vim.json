  "description": "Not being totally satisfied with other color schemes out there, I created my own scheme.\n\nIt has a dark blue-grey background and uses a diverse set of attractive and constracting colors for foreground text.\n\nI use it largely for Java and XSL development although I'm also quite content with how C++ and ASP code looks in it too.\n\nThe only draw back to this color scheme is that while on a CRT monitor the colors appear quite clear and constrasting, the contrast dies out a bit on my laptop's screen. (For use on laptop screens, I would recommend making the background black.)",
