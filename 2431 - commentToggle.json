  "description": "A little script for toggling commenting on a per line basis:\n toggling means that commenting is turned on and off with one shortcut (\"\\;\" by default), and\n per line basis means that it only uses single line comments (greater flexibility).\n\nIn theory, should work for all filetypes; in practice it probably won't. As of version 0.1, definitions are included for 56 languages, and for all the others, it attempts to guess the comment symbol.",
