  "description": "\"      Repetition of words is sign of bad style in most languages. This script\n\"      will help to track repetition of words in LaTeX, HTML and mail files.\n\"\n\"      LaTeX: don't take into account \\keywords\n\"      HTML: don't highlight content of tags\n\"      Mail: don't look in quoted messages, headers and signatures \n\"\n\"      There is also support for any other filetype. StyleChecker will\n\"      highlight there only repeated words in comments.\n\"\n\"      This script requires Perl interface. Theoretically it could be done in\n\"      pure VimL but multiple iterations through long lists of words make it\n\"      practically impossible - vote for arrays in VimL!\n\"\n\" Installation:\n\"      Put this file into your .vim/macros directory and source it from local\n\"      ftplugins. Of course you can place this file in .vim/plugin directory\n\"      but this file will be sourced every time you open Vim.\n\"\n\" Usage:\n\"      Default shorcut for style checking is ,, . You can change it by placing\n\"      in .vimrc: \n\"            map <YourShortcut> <Plug>StyleChecker\n\"\n\"      After execution of map script will highlight repeated words.\n\"      Next execution of map restore original highlighting of file.\n\"      In console Vim offending words will be highlighted with 8 colors, in GUI\n\"      with 16. \n\"      Thanks to Perl's pragma locale, language specific letters will be\n\"      treated properly. \n\"\n\" Settings:\n\"      Behavior of StyleChecker you can control through variables. They are\n\"      Vim variables, there is no need to play with Perl.\n\" More about setting variables in file.",
