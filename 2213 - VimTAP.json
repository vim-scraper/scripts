It decouples the tests generating results from the harness interpreting the results.\nWith VimTAP we now have TAP for vim.\n\nFor now the following is implemented:\n - Plan\n - Ok\n - Is & Isnt\n - Like & Unlike\n - Diag\n\nDiag is probably not completely functional, yet. \\n, \\r and \\r\\n are all considered to\ndelimit lines.\n\nAlso a driver for running the tests from outside vim is provided. It can be used with\nPerl's TAP::Parser runtests utility.\n\nThis package is still work in progress!",
