This page no longer contains the most recent version of the plugin.\n\nhttp://vim-ruby.rubyforge.org\nhttp://rubyforge.org\n\nThis is a compiler plugin for the Ruby language.  Not terribly glamorous, but it does take advantage of multi-line errorformats, and it's a little more graceful than the errorformats I've seen so far.",
