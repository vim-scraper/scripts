If you always want CodeOverview, put the first two\ncommands in your .vimrc. The last command is just to force refresh for\nyour current file.\n\nUsage :\n======\n:ShowCodeOverview \n    Start the overview panel.\n\n:HideCodeOverview \n    Hide the overview panel\n    Also stop automatic overview generation.\n\n:CodeOverviewNoAuto \n    Disable automatic overview generation.\n\n:CodeOverviewAuto \n    Setup automatic overview generation.\n\n:SnapshotFile \n    Refresh your current overview.\n\nAs some requested, Here's the code source of binary parts, it's a little messy, sorry :\nhttp://github.com/Twinside/CodeOverview\n\nKnown problems :\n==============\n- View doesn't really track vim scrolling\nIt's the current trade-off between performance and functionality.",
