Says:  day of week, day of month, month, and time in 24-hour format.  Not a vimscript, but seems relevant.  You might also try my gradually changing color scheme for vim: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2658.",

AutoIT 3.0 installer creates entries in the right-click context menu of Explorer to allow you to create the .exe.  I advice to put a shortcut to it in your Windows start-up group, or start it manually.",
