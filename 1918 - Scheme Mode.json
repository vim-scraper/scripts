  "description": "\" This is a simple fileplugin supposed to help you write Scheme code fast.\" Comes with shortcuts for usual patterns such as `if`, `cond`, `case`, as\" well as `let`s (normal, letrec and named let), `syntax-rules`, and eventually\" a header generator and shortcuts to inser (print) lilke statements.\" Since many of those patterns have placeholders for code, `f and `s tags are\" mapped to what can be thought of as 1st place and 2nd place. For example, in\" an `if`, first place is the #t branch, and second place is the #f branch\"\" Little help with motions is given too. Mapped <C-l> and <C-h> to the next and\" previous Sexp, in depth parsing order.\"\" You are more than suggested to define the bindings as you want them.\" I chose <Leader>sX so that the \"s\" reminds you scheme, though is slows down\" typing quite a bit. Moreover, you might not want a 3 keyed shortcut to start a\" quoted list...\"\" Also comes with a function that closes all open brackets.",
