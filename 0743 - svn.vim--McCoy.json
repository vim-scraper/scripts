  "description": "A simple utility for using SVN within vim.  Mostly just aliases for combining writing your file, commiting and updating your repository within vim.  I use gvim, so the default editor ``Commit'' or ``Svn commit'' doesn't work.  For this reason, with a little bit of trickery I made my system open up the log addition inline.  This means with two simple commands, you've written your current file, commited your repository, and updated your changes...without leaving your vim window :)\n\nYou can also do this with key mappings, so makes it even easier.\n\nIts still somewhat primative, though its coming along.\nCheck back frequently for updates.\nSuggestions and Patches are always welcome!\n\nHappy Vimming!",

The window is then closed, and its all done quietly.  I also added 'Svn log' and 'Log' commands that open up the log in a new window and move your cursor to the top :)  This thing is almost cool now"
