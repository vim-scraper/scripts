(Actually, it's evolved to have nothing\n\"                in common with   :only   anymore, but I liked the ^W^O,\n\"                and <C-W><C-_> had no catchy name.)\n\"\n\"\n\" Version:       1.1\n\"\n\" Author:        Eric Arnold ( eric_p_arnold in_the_vicinity_of yahoo.com )\n\"\n\" Description:   Remaps ^W^O   ^W^W   ^W^K   and a few related keys to\n\"                fully expand the current window without closing any.\n\"                Emphasis is on simplicity, key ergonomics and usability.\n\"                I wanted something I would actually use all the time.\n\"                Your [personal preference] milage may vary.  I used the\n\"                ^W keys to move through windows before, so tried to\n\"                integrate smoothly with them.  Small bumps in the\n\"                original are smoothed out, i.e. ^W^J and ^W^K wrap\n\"                around.\n\"\n\" <C-W><C-O>     Toggle the Only Window Mode ON/OFF.   \n\"                <C-W><C-O>   <C-W><C-_>   <C-W>o   are synonymous.\n\"                <C-W>O toggles auto-expand.\n\"                The rest of the keys are only mapped when Only Window Mode ON.\n\"\n\" Mouse          Window will resize when the mouse cursor enters it or\n\"                its [clicked]statusbar.  See config section.\n\"\n\"\n\" <C-W><C-K>     Up one window, resize to full, wrap around at top.\n\"\n\" <C-W><C-W>     Next/Down one window, ditto.  \n\"                <C-W><C-J> is synonymous.\n\"\n\" <C-W>w or j    Next window, and resize to 1/2 total &lines, giving the\n\"                previous window the other half, wrap around at bottom.\n\"                These provide a way to move around with a little more\n\"                visibility without leaving Only Window Mode.\n\"\n\" <C-W>k         Previous window, ditto.\n\"\n\"\n\"        Note:  if  \"g:ToggleOnlyAutoExpand\"  is set (true by default),\n\"        windows will be expanded when *anything* moves the cursor into\n\"        them.\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"    Configuration Notes:    \n\"\n\"        Whether you need to click on the statusbar depends on how you\n\"        have \"&mousefocus\" set.  You can tone down the aggressive\n\"        behavior of the auto-expand by turning \"&mousefocus\" off,\n\"        without disabliing auto-expand altogether.\n\"\n\"\n\"        \"timeout\" and \"ttimeout\" are turned off since it's extra\n\"        annoying when it times out to the default ^W^O, which closes all\n\"        other windows.  You may want to reset these if you have\n\"        mappings like   ,s  and   ,st    which depend on a timeout \n\"        for  ,s   to be accepted, or some other key, i.e.  ,s<ESC>   \n\"        works without timeouts.\n\"        \"g:ToggleOnlyTimeouts\"  is \"exe\"'d, so get your syntax\n\"        right.  If want timeouts, try something like this in your\n\"        \".vimrc\":\n\"\n\"    let g:ToggleOnlyTimeouts = 'set timeout ttimeout timeoutlen=2000 ttimeoutlen=2000'\n\"\n\"        An autocommand is set for \"BufEnter\" to resize any window, \n\"        which allows you to mouse into a window and have it resize.\n\"        This is controled by:\n\"\n\"    let g:ToggleOnlyAutoExpand = 1\n\"\n\"        To save space when the windows are minimized, \"&winminheight\" is\n\"        set to zero.  This is changed with:\n\"\n\"    let g:ToggleOnlywinminheight = 0\n\"\n\"\n\"\n\"    Updated:        Wed Jun 08, 6/8/2005 5:14:07 PM\n\"          General overall refinement.\n\"     -    Now uses ^K and k, ^W and w, which is better than O and o.\n\"     -    All keys wrap around at top/bottom, not just ^W.\n\"     -    Added a BufEnter autocommand so mouse will trigger resize\n\"     -    Keymaps are more correct (nnoremap instead of map), and are\n\"          only mapped when ^W^O toggles them on.\n\"     -    Set &winminheight to 0 to save space around statusbars.\n\"     -    Added a few config options.  Keymap timeout issue addressed, and\n\"          config option added.\n\"     -    Added a two window auto expand option\n\n",
