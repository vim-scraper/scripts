Anyone is more than welcome to pick/clean this up.  Usage is\nstraight forward and there is latent ( read: not working ) support for setting breakpoints from vim.  \nI wrote this a while ago so it's not a stellar example of using ATL etc.\n\nUsage:  :vc <cmd>\nwhere <cmd> is any exported command in Visual Studio.  See the keybindings to see all of the different commands.\n\nIt's also available at my web page as well as other vim stuff\nhttp://www.nh.ultranet.com/~bsturk\n\n",
