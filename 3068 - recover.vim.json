The aim of this plugin is, to\nhave an easy way to see differences, between the recovered files and the files\nrestored on disk.\n\nTherefore this plugin sets up an auto command, that will create a diff buffer\nbetween the recovered file and the on-disk version of the same file. You can\neasily see, what has been changed and save your recovered work back to the\nfile on disk.\n\nBy default this plugin is enabled. To disable it, use >\n    :RecoverPluginDisable\n\nTo enable this plugin again, use >\n    :RecoverPluginEnable\n\n3. ChangesPlugin Feedback                                   *recover-feedback*\n\nFeedback is always welcome. If you like the plugin, please rate it at the\nvim-page:\nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3068\n\nYou can also follow the development of the plugin at github:\nhttp://github.com/chrisbra/Recover.vim\n\nPlease don't hesitate to report any bugs to the maintainer, mentioned in the\nthird line of this document.\n",
