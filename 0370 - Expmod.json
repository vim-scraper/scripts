  "description": "expatch adds 2 new commands to explorer.vim: v and g\nv - view graphic file\ng - get full file name and store it in global variable\n\nIt works also with mouse and <Enter>:\nv == <2-LeftMouse> == <Enter> (if file is graphic file)\ng == <2-S-LeftMouse>\n\nexpmod.vim takes care about global variable. Behaviour of <F8> depends\non file name and file type of current buffer. The most dramatic effects\nare if ft=html.\nFor graphic files it _o_pens new line and inserts:\n<img src=\"relative_path\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" alt=\"short_file_name\"\nborder=\"0\">\n\nrelative_path is a relative path from edited file to graphic file. E.g.\n\"../images/alpha.gif\"\ndimensions are given by identify\nshort_file_name is short file name ;)\nborder is default value.\n\nFor all other files it inserts:\n<a href=\"relative_path\" class=\"\">\n\n<F8> works also for other 'ft' values:\nFor php: include(\"relative_path\");\nFor c: #include <relative_path>\n",
  "install_details": "This is version for *nix systems. It can be easily modified for other\nsystems. Alas, it is rather impossible to create one cross-system\nversion since this plugin depends on external tools:\n- xli for viewing graphic files (I believe it is in all systems with\n  XFree)  \n- identify from ImageMagick package for image dimensions\n\nexpatch is a patch for regular explorer.vim\npatch explorer.vim < expatch\n\nexpmod.vim is a plugin file. \nDrop it into your plugin directory.\n",
