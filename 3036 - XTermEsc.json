  "description": "This highlights text based on xterm escape sequences using the appropriate color. This is similar to the AnsiEsc script but does not depend on the Conceal patch.  (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=302)\n\nThis is done using one of two modes and is configured by setting the g:xterm_trim_escapes variable. When set to 0, escape sequences will be left in the buffer and highlighted using the Ignore group. When set to 1 and the buffer is modifiable, escape sequences will be deleted and highlighting will be performed based on row-column matching. Row-column matching may not work well if the file is being edited but is appropriate under some circumstances. Note that this only affect the escape sequences themselves, not highlighted text.",
  "install_details": "Copy xterm.vim to your local syntax directory and use `:setf xterm' when you want highlighting.",
