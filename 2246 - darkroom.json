  "description": "This is my attempt to create a simple WriteRoom/DarkRoom like environment in Vim. \n\nIt is probably not ready for prime-time yet. \n\nIt will almost certainly interact badly with any other plugins/scripts that hack buffers as it uses two hidden buffers to get the column feel of DarkRoom.\n\nYou will want to \":set wrap lbr\" for it to work most effectively.\nYou will want to maximize vim before calling \":colorscheme darkroom\" for it to look reasonable.\nYou will also need to use :qa to exit (or :q several times in succession)\n\n\n",
