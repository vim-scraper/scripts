If you get an error, you don't have python. \n\nIncluded scripts are:\n\n- vimp3 - music player for vim (scores, random mode taking scores into account, multiple playlists per file, option to pause between tracks; note: other scripts will work in win/linux, this one is only for linux)\n- outliner similar to TVO\n- todo list manager\n- project manager (load/unload by dir/project, make an outline of python files, etc)\n- calendar that supports adding notes to dates\n- plugin to track expenses and balances\n- sortable table with fields separated by 2+ spaces\n- resize - set a list of main vim window sizes and use two shortcuts to resize -/+\n- helpgrep - enter a few words and use :helpgrep cmd to search for them in any order\n- pystripdoc - make a copy of buffer with stripped out python docstrings and comments\n- pyfolddoc - fold python docstrings and comments\n- aligncode - align code by '=' or '#' chars\n\nFor a more detailed description, see home page: http://lightbird.net/pysuite/.",
