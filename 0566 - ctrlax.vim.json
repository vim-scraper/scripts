  "description": "The plugin implements an enhanced version of vim's incrementing features with\n<C-A> and <C-X> using functions to find and replace strings according to any\ninline scheme.\n\nBy default vim behaviour is emulated, plus it cycles through names of months\nand week days (trying full name, then abbreviated).\n\nThe language for months and week days is English, but it is fairly straight\nforward to localise this. An example of localisation is provided in the\ndocumentation.\n\nExtra functions meant to assist in writing new functions are included, too.",
