  "description": "As you probably know, WriteRoom (http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) is a very minimalistic text editor, focusing on a clean appearance of just the edited document. This script creates &#039padding&#039 around the editing window in gVim and hides the vertical splits and other items to obtain this same effect, while keeping all of Vim&#039s extensive features available. \n\nUsing the file is simple, just issue a gvim -S ~/.vim/writeroom/writeroom.vim {filename} at the command line to open the file in a very clean, minimalist setup. Perfect for ADD-ers like myself ;-)\n\nThis file adds the following:\n\nCommands:\n=========\n\nWriteRoomBG {color} ; sets the background color\nWriteRoomFG {color} ; sets the foreground color\nWriteRoomFilename {color} ; sets the color for the filename just below the editing window\nWriteRoomNonText {color} ; sets the color for non-text characters\n\nFunctions:\n==========\n\nUpdateScreen() ; updates the screen size and colors\n\nMappings:\n=========\n\n<F5> toggles visibility of EOL, TAB and tilde lines\n\n\n",
