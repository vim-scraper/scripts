  "script_type": "color scheme",
  "description": "marklar.vim is designed for gvim. It is used daily on both gvim and an 8 color\nxterm terminal (Terminal.app on os x).  The colors are designed to take full\nadvantage of gvim while still being recognizable (and useful) in the limited\ncolor environment.\n\nThe colors are chosen with regard to contrast, semantics and use. \n\nFor general reading, a medium contrast colors that minimize eye strain.\n\nIn situations where immediate attention to change is appropriate, strong stark\ncontrast. Errors, warnings, mode labels, for example.\n\nElements of the interface (or bits that vim wants to hide, like IGNORE), low\ncontrast.\n\nFor example, in diff mode, a blue-tinted background indicates added text, a\nred-tinted background indicates deleted text. For incsearch, a yellow-tint\nshows the match in progress. \n\nGreen is the reference color, two specific shades, in rgb: text=#71C293\nbackground=#06544a.\n\nIf the background and foreground color of your terminal can be set to these\ncolors, this colorscheme will work, even for terminals that only have 8 color\nsupport. Terminal.app on os x is an example.  I am sure there are others.\n\nGreen is the easiest color for human eyes to see. By easiest, I mean that there\nare far more green frequency color receptors in the retina than the blue or red\nones. Early monotone computer monitors chose green phosphors for this reason. I\nstarted this scheme based on a memory of an old hp monitor, but I ended up with\na color that reminds me of a green chalkboard.\n\nI use vim and its syntax highlighting to catch mistakes and recognize patterns\nin code. As I expand my use of vim as a tool, I make adjustments to contrasts.\nColors are completely a matter of taste, but this colorscheme has been designed\nincrementally from constant use. I hope you will try it.\n\n-- new -- \n\nOptional Settings.  (requires vim7) \n\nWorks much like options in vim, except using :Marklar in place of :set. A few\nexamples should make it clear.\n\n    :Marklar        <- displays a list of available options\n    :Marklar bold!  <- toggles the setting of the bold option\n    :Marklar bold?  <- queries the value of the bold option\n    :Marklar bold 1 <- sets the bold option to 1 (on).\n\nThe options:\n\n    bold   <- activates bold for a group of commonly used highlight regions.\n    ignore <- toggles Ignore region between nearly and completely invisible.\n\nThe default settings are : bold 0, ignore 1. If you prefer different defaults\nuse the :Marklar command in your .vimrc file, to set your preferences.\n",
