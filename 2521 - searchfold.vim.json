  "description": "This script is an improved version of  f.vim  (vimscript #318).\n\nImprovements: folding depth is limited, previous fold settings can be restored, pattern is always the last search pattern.\n\nScript uses manual folds.  The user's manual folds are not preserved (unlike vimscript #2302 does it).\n\n\nUsage:\n\n<Leader>z\nfold away lines not matching the last search pattern\n\n<Leader>Z\nrestore the previous fold settings\n\n:call F()\nkeep it backwards compatible ...\n\n\nCustomization:\n\n:let g:searchfold_maxdepth = 7\n(number) maximum fold depth\n\n:let g:searchfold_usestep = 0\n(boolean)\nPer default, each \"zr\" (after \"\\z\") unfolds 1 more line above the cursor, but several (= step) lines below the cursor.  Set this var to 1 to get the same amount of lines above the cursor.\n\n:let g:searchfold_postZ_do_zv = 1\n(boolean)\nIf 1, execute \"zv\" (view cursor line) after <Leader>Z.\n",
