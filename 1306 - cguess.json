  "description": "Cguess is a (Yet another?) C/C++/Java syntax auto-completer meant to be used as a plugin for VIM text editor or others. See its homepage: http://www.zabor.org/cguess and the README file for details.\n\nThis is an early version and is quite limited. It works the \"intellisense\"-style way but the interface is quite primitive in this version. It maps several key combinations in insert mode and will show a list of members in a splitted window, function prototypes or the list of enumerators in comparisons (after typing == or !=) whenever possible.\n\nCguess is based on a true C++ language parser (like the compilers) and understands even the most complex syntactic constructs (but it will refuse to parse programs that contain errors). The parser supports several GNU extensions to C and C++ and some ISO and ANSI specific ideas.\n\nJava is not supported.\n\nIf you use cguess, help Uganda.",
  "install_details": "Cguess now works on GNU/Linux, GNU/Hurd, FreeBSD and OpenBSD with GCC installed, but will be made more portable in future.\n\nTo install simply untar and do the following:\n./configure       # type ./configure --help to see options\nmake\nmake install     # requires permissions\n\nAfter you start editing a C or C++ file for the first time please check if the value of g:cguessCFLAGS (type \":echo g:cguessCFLAGS\") is correct for your system. If you type \":let g:cguessVertical=0\", the identifiers will be displayed together with their types in a window above the buffer you're editing. There are some more variables you may want to customize. Set the values from inside your .vimrc to make them permanent.\n\nAfter you get tired of it, just go to the same directory and type:\nmake uninstall\nIf you had removed the directory, untar it again and rerun configure with the same parameters first.",
