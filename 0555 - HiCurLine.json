  "description": "This script has a number of maps that intercept various motions and cause the current line to be highlighted.  It is a variant of <HiMtchBrkt.vim> (vimtip#177).\n\n    \\hcli : initiate HiCurLine operation\n    \\hcls : stop HiCurLine operation\n\n(see vimtip#411 to have HiCurLine automatically begin highlighting)\n\nHiCurLine.vim uses the HL_HiCurLine highlighting group (by default) to specify the highlighting of the current line.  One may change the highlighting group HiCurLine uses with the g:HL_HiCurLine variable.  By default,\n\n\tlet g:HL_HiCurLine= \"HL_HiCurLine\"\n\nand <HiCurLine.vim> will specify that group internally.  Otherwise, one may change the group used to whatever one wishes:\n\n\tlet g:HL_HiCurLine= \"Search\"\n\tlet g:HL_HiCurLine= \"Function\"\n\netc.  The default highlighting is: (background is a setting, see :he 'bg')\n\n\tbackground == dark : blue text on cyan background\n\tbackground == light: cyan text on blue background\n\n(alpha/beta version available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#HICURLINE)\n",

      "release_notes": "Several small improvements this time: HiCurLine now uses CursorHold to update its highlighting when the colorscheme has been changed.  More motion support: gg and G.  The highlighting group HL_HiCurLine is used, thereby permitting the user to override it.  The g:HL_HiCurLine variable is \"HL_HiCurLine\" by default, but the user may change that (ex. let g:HL_HiCurLine=\"Search\").\n"
