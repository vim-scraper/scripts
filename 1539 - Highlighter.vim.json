  "description": "This plugin gives you the capability to mark up your files as if you had a highlighter.\n\nIt's a really useful aid for inspecting log files and marking important sections in source code and documents (even vim help files).\n\nThe highlights are remembered, even after you close the file. You can also distribute the marks so others can see the highlights you've made.\n\nThere are a number of different highlighters available for use. (NOTE: you will probably want to create mappings for these commands)\n:WordHighlighter\nHighlight the word under the cursor\n\n:SelectionHighlighter\nHighlight the current selection. A visual mapping for this command is recommended.\n\n:SearchPatternHighlighter\nHighlight the current search pattern.\n\n:ClearAllHighlighters\nClear all highlights made in this file.\n\n:ClearCurrentHighligher\nClear the Highlighter under the cursor\n\n:ConfigureHighlighter\nOpen the configure window. From here you can configure how the highlighter colors are determined - randomized, use a favorite color, etc.\n\nLook under Plugin->Highlighter for more options.\n\nThe highlighter only works with gvim and 'syntax' must be on.  Also, the terminal must support vim colors in the format #rrggbb.\n\nComments/suggestions/complaints are gladly taken.",
