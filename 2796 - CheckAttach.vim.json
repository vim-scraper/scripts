  "description": "If you like the plugin, please rate it!\n\nYou can now follow the plugin at github: http://github.com/chrisbra/CheckAttach\n\n                                                                  *CheckAttach*\n1. Functionality\n\nWhen using mutt as your mail user agent, you can specify which files to attach\nusing the pseudo header :Attach. This only works when edit_headers is set in\nyour .muttrc configuration file. See the mutt manual for further information\nabout that topic.\n\nA simple version of this plugin has been posted to the mutt-users list (see\nhttp://marc.info/?i=20090116091203.GB3197%20()%20256bit%20!%20org) and\nafter using it for some time, I decided to make a plugin out of it.\n\nThis plugin checks, whether certain keywords exist in your mail, and if found,\nyou'll be asked to attach the files. This is done to prevent that you sent\nmails in which you announce to attach some files but actually forget to attach\nthe files so that your have to write a second mail which often is quite\nembarassing.\n\nTherefore this plugin checks for the presence of keywords which indicate that\nan attachment should be attached. If if finds these keywords, the plugin will\nask you for the files to attach, whenever you save your mail.\n\nThis looks like this:\nAttach file: (leave empty to abbort):\n\nAt that prompt you can specify any file you'd like to attach. It allows\nfilename completion, so you can use <Tab> to let vim complete file paths.\nAdditionally you can specify glob patterns and let vim attach all files, that\nmatch the pattern. So if you enter ~/.vim/plugin/*.vim vim would add for each\nplugin it finds an Attach-header.  If you enter an empty value or \"n\" (without\nthe quotes), no file will be attached.\n\nThe plugin will by default escape blank space in your filename by using '&#039.\nmutt before version 1.5.20 had a bug, that would not allow you to add files\nwhose filename contain spaces. If you are using mutt version smaller 1.5.20\nthis means you would have to rename those files first before attaching them.\n(See mutt bug 3179: http://dev.mutt.org/trac/ticket/3179)\n\nYou can specify which keywords will be searched by setting the\ng:attach_check_keywords variable. By default this variable is specified as:\nlet g:attach_check_keywords = 'attach,attachment,angeh√§ngt,Anhang'\nso that it can handle German and English. If you would like to add the keyword\nfoobar, use this command:\nlet g:attach_check_keywords .=',foobar'\n\n                                         *EnableCheckAttach* *DisableCheckAttach*\nYou can disable the plugin by issuing the command\n:DisableCheckAttach\nEnabling the attachment check is then again enabled by issuing\n:EnableCheckAttach\nYou can also use the ! attribute when saving your buffer to temporarily skip\nthe check. So if you use :w! the buffer will not be checked for attachments,\nonly if you use :w it will.\n\n\n==============================================================================\n2.
