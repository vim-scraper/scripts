Please note that I didn't write this -- it was downloaded from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%3AText_editor_support#Vim and may well be more up-to-date there.  If the version here is out of date contact me and I'll upload the improved version.\n\nVersion 1 of this script also contains a few settings to better deal with the fact that MediaWiki articles only contain newlines between paragraphs, you may prefer to remove those and put them in ~/.vim/ftplugin/Wikipedia.vim.  In version 2 these have been moved to a separate file.",
