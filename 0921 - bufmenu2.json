I searched for a script doing a nicer job. None :(\nI wrote it myself. Not very quickly wrote, not very quick\nat execution on my 350 Mhz ppc, BUT you should try\nit to see if more balanced hierarchy fits your need.\nHey this is free ;)\nScreenshots of the difference on a silly example\nare available there : http://lauranger.free.fr/bufmenu_two.html",
