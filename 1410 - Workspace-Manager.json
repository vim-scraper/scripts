  "description": "The workspace plugin allows you to easily access groups of frequently used\nfiles and run any command on a selected set of files from the workspace.\n\nYou can create one or more groups in a workspace. Each group can contain\nadditional sub-groups. The workspace and the groups can contain one or more\nfilenames.\n\nThe contents of a workspace are saved in a user specified file. This allows\nyou to create multiple workspaces and to load the desired workspace when\nneeded.\n\nYou can run any Vim ex command or an external shell command on a selected\ngroup of files from the workspace.\n\nFor more information about using this plugin, after installing the\nworkspace plugin, use the \":help workspace\" command.\n\nThe workspace plugin manual is also available online at:\n     http://www.geocities.com/yegappan/workspace/workspace.html\n",
  "install_details": "1. Download the workspace.zip file and unzip the files to the $HOME/.vim\n   or the $HOME/vimfiles or the $VIM/vimfiles directory. This should\n   unzip the following two files (the directory structure should be\n   preserved):\n\n      plugin/workspace.vim - main workspace plugin file\n      doc/workspace.txt    - documentation (help) file\n\n   Refer to the 'add-plugin', 'add-global-plugin' and 'runtimepath'\n   Vim help pages for more details about installing Vim plugins.\n2. Change to the $HOME/.vim/doc or $HOME/vimfiles/doc or\n   $VIM/vimfiles/doc directory, start Vim and run the \":helptags .\"\n   command to process the workspace help file.\n3. If you are running a terminal/console version of Vim and the terminal\n    doesn't support changing the window width then set the \n    'Ws_Inc_Winwidth' variable to 0 in the .vimrc file.\n5. Restart Vim.\n6. You can now use the \":WsOpen <filename>\" command to open a\n     workspace. You can use the \":help workspace\" command to get \n     more information about using the workspace plugin.\n",
