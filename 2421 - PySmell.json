  "install_details": "Uninstall the .tar.gz, cd into it and do:\n\npython setup.py install\n\nTo use PySmell omnicompletion from inside Vim, you have to have:\n\n1. Python support in vim (`:echo has('python')`)\n2. The pysmell package in the PYTHONPATH that Vim uses: `python import pysmell` should work.\n3. Drop pysmell.vim in ~/.vim/plugins\n4. `:setlocal omnifunc=pysmell#Complete` Note: If you want to always use pysmell for python, do: `autocmd FileType python setlocal omnifunc=pysmell#Complete`\n5. [OPTIONAL] Select a matcher of your liking - look at pysmell.vim for\noptions. Eg: `:let g:pysmell_matcher='camel-case'`\n\n",
