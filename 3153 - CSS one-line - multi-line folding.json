One line CSS is easier to scan through and saves space, but multi-line CSS is easier to grep and edit.\n\nThis script sets you up so you edit and save multi-line CSS, but when you turn folding on, everything´s compressed on one line so you can scan through it easier.\n\nControls are vim´s standard for text folding:\nzo and zc: Open and Close fold (set multiline, set oneline)\nzR and zM: Reopen and Close all (globally set multiline, globally set oneline)\nzj, zk: go down and up a fold (CSS block).\n",
