If you want to install it as your default color scheme, just add \":colo sienna\" to your vimrc file.\n\nYou can choose the style by adding one of the following lines to your vimrc or gvimrc file before sourcing the color scheme:\n\nlet g:sienna_style = 'dark'\nlet g:sienna_style = 'light'\n\nIf none of above lines is given, the light style is choosen.\n\nYou can switch between these styles by using the :Colo command, like \":Colo dark\" or \":Colo light\" (many thanks to Pan Shizhu for the idea).\n\nHappy Vimming!",
