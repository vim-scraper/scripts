  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "DESCRIPTION\nRe-executes the last / Nth ex command previously entered in command mode. An\noptional pattern is used to locate the most recent matching command. This is\nsimilar to the command-line window (q:), or navigating the command history via\n<Up> and <Down>, but provides an even faster way to re-execute a command if\nyou remember some characters or a pattern that identifies the command line.\nThe redocommand itself will not be included in the command history. Global\nliteral replacement can be done via 'old=new' arguments. \n\nThis is modeled after the 'fc -s' command from the Posix shell (which is often\naliased to 'r'). \n\nUSAGE\n:[N]Redocommand (or abbreviated :R)\n\t\t\tExecute the last / Nth ex command. \n\n:[N]Redocommand {pattern}\n\t\t\tExecute the last / Nth ex command that matches\n\t\t\t{pattern}.\n\t\t\tSettings such as 'magic' and 'ignorecase' apply. \n\n\t\t\tWith N=0, only the very last command from the history\n\t\t\tis executed if it matches {pattern}; the entire\n\t\t\thistory isn't searched. \n\n:[N]Redocommand old=new [old2=new2 ...] [{pattern}]\n\t\t\tExecute the last / Nth ex command (that matches\n\t\t\t{pattern}), replacing all literal occurrences of 'old'\n\t\t\twith 'new'. \n\nEXAMPLE\nGiven the following history:\n    :history\n    1 e foo.txt \n    2 %s/foo/\\0bar/g \n    3 w bar.txt \n:Redocommand\t\twill execute :w bar.txt\n:Redocommand %\t\twill execute :%s/foo\\0/bar/g\n:Redocommand foo\twill execute :%s/foo\\0/bar/g\n:2Redocommand foo\twill execute :e foo.txt\n:Redocommand b=B .txt=\twill execute ':w bar.txt' as :w Bar",
