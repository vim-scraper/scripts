For further instructions, see here: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1152\n\nThe only thing I added is the ability to set path mapping in your .vimrc (or wherever)\n\nFor example:\nlet pathMap=\"/mnt/hgfs:/home/ethanm/vmfiles, /home/config:/home/ethanm/config\"\nwould adjust my xdebug paths so that I could now work with a local editor on files running in my VM.",
