The following RCS types are supported:\n\n * CVS\n * Subversion (SVN)\n * Git\n * Mercurial\n \nThis plugin runs a diff between the current buffer and the original\nfile from svn or git, and shows coloured signs indicating where the buffer\ndiffers from the original file from the repository. The original\ntext is not shown, only signs are used to indicate where changes were made.\n\nThe plugin can be used for files managed with subversion or GIT. The type of\nRCS will be detected when first issuing a svndiff command on the file.\n\nThe following symbols and syntax highlight groups are used for the signs:\n\n  > DiffAdd:    Newly added lines. (default=blue)\n\n  ! DiffChange: Lines which are changed from the original. (default=cyan)\n\n  < DiffDel:    Applied to the lines directly above and below a deleted block\n                (default=magenta)\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe plugin defines one function: Svndiff(). This function figures out the\ndifference between the current buffer and it's svn/git original, and adds\nthe signs at the places where the buffer differs from the original file from\nsvn or git. You'll need to call this function after making changes to update\nthe highlighting.\n\nThe function takes one argument specifying an additional action to perform:\n\n  \"prev\"  : jump to the previous different block\n  \"next\"  : jump to the next different block\n  \"clear\" : clean up all signs\n\nYou might want to map some keys to run the Svndiff function. For\nexample, add to your .vimrc:\n\n  noremap <F3> :call Svndiff(\"prev\")<CR>\n  noremap <F4> :call Svndiff(\"next\")<CR>\n  noremap <F5> :call Svndiff(\"clear\")<CR>\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nThe following configuration variables are availabe:\n\n* g:svndiff_autoupdate\n\n  If this variable is defined, svndiff will automatically update the signs\n  when the user stops typing for a short while, and when leaving insert\n  mode. This might slow things down on large files, so use with caution.\n  The vim variable 'updatetime' can be used to set the auto-update intervar,\n  but not that changing this variable other effects as well. (refer to the\n  vim docs for more info)\n  To use, add to your .vimrc:\n\n  let g:svndiff_autoupdate = 1\n\n* g:svndiff_one_sign_delete\n\n  Normally, two 'delete' signs are placed around the location where\n  text was deleted. When this variable is defined, only one sign is\n  placed, above the location of the deleted text.\n  To use, add to your .vimrc:\n\n  let g:svndiff_one_sign_delete = 1\n\nColors\n------\n\nPersonally, I find the following colours more intuitive for diff colours:\nred=deleted, green=added, yellow=changed. If you want to use these colours,\ntry adding the following lines to your .vimrc\n\nhi DiffAdd      ctermfg=0 ctermbg=2 guibg='green'\nhi DiffDelete   ctermfg=0 ctermbg=1 guibg='red'\nhi DiffChange   ctermfg=0 ctermbg=3 guibg='yellow'\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n1.0 2007-04-02  Initial version\n\n1.1 2007-04-02  Added goto prev/next diffblock commands\n\n1.2 2007-06-14  Updated diff arguments from -u0 (obsolete) to -U0\n\n2.0 2007-08-16  Changed from syntax highlighting to using signs, thanks\n                to Noah Spurrier for the idea. NOTE: the name of the\n                function changed from Svndiff_show() to Svndiff(), so\n                you might need to update your .vimrc mappings!\n\n3.0 2008-02-02  Redesign with some ideas from Jan Bezdekovsky. The\n                diff is only updated when the buffer actually changes,\n                cleanup of signs is now done properly and some info\n                about each diff block is printed in the status line.\n\n3.1 2008-02-04  Fixed bug that broke plugin in non-english locales, thanks\n                to Bernhard Walle for the patch\n\n3.2 2008-02-27  The latest rewrite broke vim 6 compatiblity. The plugin\n                is now simply disabled for older vim versions to avoid\n\n                a lot of warnings when loading.\n\n4.0 2008-11-24  Added GIT support. The RCS type is now detected (svn/git)\n\n4.1 2008-11-25  Added CVS support\n\n4.3 2010-05-08  Added support for Mercurial, fixed git support (thanks \n                          Frankovskyi Bogdan)\n\n",
