  "description": "IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT VIM AND GVIM USING THE SAME COLORS, THIS COLORSCHEME IS NOT FOR YOU!!!  (guess I'm tired of those who complain about the use of only 8 colors...)\n\nThis colorscheme is a dark-background style colorscheme with the advantage that it works with console/terminal vim in the same way that it works with GUI vim.  Thus it is restricted to using just the basic eight colors that many xterms are limited to.\n\nThe <astronaut.vim> file gives you my dark background preferred colorscheme.  If you'd like to see a preview, check out\n   \n http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/colors/colorscheme.html\n    \nwhich has a small picture of yacc code being highlighted by <astronaut.vim>.\n          \nAs of version 2 of the astronaut colorscheme, <astronaut.vim> supports some options which help console vims display properly.  There's a help file (doc/astronaut.txt) which you can enable by typing in a vim\n                     \n    :helptags ~/.vim/doc/\n                         \n(correct the path as needed).  The options include:\n                                \n  let astronaut_bold=1      : use the bold modifier for term, cterm, and gui\n\n  let astronaut_dark=1      : dark colors used (otherwise some terminals\n                              make everything bold, which can be all one\n                              color)\n\n  let astronaut_underline=1 : assume that underlining works on your terminal\n                              Otherwise some groups will have dark-magenta\n                              background highlighting.\n\nFor example, on my old Sgi workstation, I've found that the Irix o/s needs let astronaut_dark=1 even though its only an 8-color terminal.  Otherwise most everything shows up as yellow.\n",
  "install_details": "1. Put <astronaut.tar.gz> into your \n      Unix:  .vim/\n      Win:    _vimfiles\\\n   directory\n\n2. Decompress:  gunzip astronaut.tar.gz\n\n3. Extract:  tar -oxvf astronaut.tar\n\n2. Put any options you want before a\n     colors astronaut\n   line into your <.vimrc>.",
