The scope of TeX_9 is to rely\n    first and foremost on features that are already available in Vim and try\n    to keep things as simple and snappy as possible. Indeed, TeX_9's codebase\n    is only about 500 SLOC.\n    \n    Most of TeX_9 is implemented in Python (2.6) and therefore a Vim\n    installation with Python support is required.  In addition, TeX_9 depends\n    on the matchit plugin (>= 1.13.2) by Benji Fisher.  Matchit is shipped with\n    the standard installation of Vim but it is also bundled with TeX_9 for\n    convenience.\n\n    TeX_9's main features are\n        * Compile, debug and view documents from within Vim \n        * Insert LaTeX code snippets with ease\n        * Select-objects for inline maths and math environments\n        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references.\n        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)\n        * LaTeX2e manual (ported to Vim by Mikolaj Machowski)\n        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings\n        \n        See GIF's here:\n        http://www.picamatic.com/show/2011/03/19/08/53/7427382_820x880.gif\n        http://www.picamatic.com/show/2011/03/19/08/53/7427384_820x880.gif\n\n\n\n    TODOs in descending priority\n        * Formatexpr for TeX\n        * Keyword completion to support maths\n        * Use Vimballs for distribution\n        * SyncTeX support & Evince\n        * Test portability\n\n    Shoutouts\n        * Carl Mueller, this ftplugin was inspired by his `auctex.vim' script\n        * Vim-LaTeX people Srinath Avadhanula, Mikolaj Machowski and Benji Fisher\n        * Johannes Tanzler\n\n    Why create a new LaTeX ftplugin?\n        * For fun of course! :-)\n        * I wanted to have something more low-key than the venerable Vim-LaTeX and something more Vimish than  \n          AucTeX.vim\n",
