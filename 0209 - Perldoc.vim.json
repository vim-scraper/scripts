  "description": "The Perldoc.vim plugin is a command + function that enables the perldoc command to be used from within the Vim text editor.  When activated the Perldoc command opens a new window at the top of the screen and places the output of the perldoc command into that window. This read-only window is just a Vim window, so you can perform all of the normal commands that you can in Vim - such as searching for a word or expression, yanking examples and code snippets.",
