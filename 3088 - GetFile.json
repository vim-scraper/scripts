  "description": "This script  caches the content of a part of the filesystem and help retrieves the appropriate file based on a pattern.\nIt has been heavily inspired by the FindFile plugin. However, this plugin is not limited to filename patterns only as you can type any part of a file path (thus including folders).\nThe plugin also comes with some options that allow faster search like automatic search 'completion' of folders, case sensitivity, ...\nThe pattern supports wildcards (* / ?).\n \nIt is a 2 step process to use:\n    1. cache the files\n    2. search through them\n\nThis is my first vim script so feel free to give me advices :)\n\nHere is the documentation that you can find inside the script header:\n\n               You can use the following functions:\n\n                 \":GetFileCacheFiles <path>\" - Caches the files. Has to be called at least once before a call to \":GetFile\".\n                 \":GetFileClearCache\" - Clear the cache.\n                 \":GetFile\" - Start searching for a file.\n\n               You may want to add the following lines in your ~/.vimrc file:\n               (or whatever shortcut you find suitable)\n\n               \"nmap <silent> <unique> fc :GetFileCacheFiles .<CR>\"\n               \"nmap <silent> <unique> ff :GetFile<CR>\"\n\n               Once in the \"[GetFile]\" buffer:\n                 \n                 Use \"<Up>\" / \"<C-p>\" and \"<Down>\" / \"<C-n>\" to select a file. \n                 \"<CR>\" opens the selected file. (If no selection done, it opens the first file).\n                 \"<ESC>\" exits the buffer.\n\n               Supported Options that you can specify in your .vimrc file:\n\n                   \"g:GetFileIgnoreList\" \n                       List of patterns to ignore.\n                       Default = ['*.o', '*.pyc', '*/tmp/*', '*~', '*/.svn/*', '*#']\n\n                   \"g:GetFileIgnoreCase\"\n                       Do not take case into account when searching files.\n                       Default = 0\n\n                   \"g:GetFileAutoFillFolder\"\n                       Speeds up the search when searching through folders as\n                       typing '/' is equivalent to typing '*/'.\n                       There are 3 possible values:\n                           0: do not use this option\n                           1: auto complete the current folder only. (match till\n                           the next '/' only)\n                           2: auto complete the entire sub hierarchy. (match\n                           till the last possible '/')\n                       Default = 1\n\n               Example of how to set an option in you .vimrc file:\n               \n                   \"let g:GetFileAutoFillFolder = 2\"\n",
