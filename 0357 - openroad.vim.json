  "description": "Some useful mappings & functions for OpenROAD programmers\n\n1) Shortcut menus for methods, procedures & event blocks  - click on a method/procedure/event name & vim jumps to that section of code.\nThese functions were based on \"incfiles.vim\" by Thomas Ramming (much changed, I hasten to add - I have actually done some work here!)\n\n2) Folding - text folds at BEGIN/END blocks - makes long files easier to navigate\n  <F3> opens folds, <F4> closes. To turn off this feature, comment out the line \"set foldmethod=marker\"\n\n3) Help on keywords - place cursor on an openroad keyword then shift-K opens the appropriate part of the openroad help file (need to use pre-4.1 MR help file)\n\n4) command completion - type part of a word, press CTRL-space & Vim will guess the rest. I've taken this from \"_vim_wok_visualcpp01.zip\" by Wolfram Esser.\n\nIt's my first vim script, so I apologise if it seems crude\n\nPaul Humphrey",
