  "description": "This plugin helps you complete things like:\nvariableName.abc\nvariableName->abc\ntypeName::abc\nfrom the members of the struct/class/union that starts with abc.\nIf you just type abc will the script complete it with the names that \nstarts with abc and ignore any current scope.\n\nThe default key mapping to complete the code are:\nAlt+l in insert mode will try to find the possible completions and display\nthem in a popup menu. Also normal completions to the names in\ncppcomplete.tags.\nAlt+j in insert mode will show the popup menu with the last results.\nSelecting one of the  items will paste the text.\nF8/F9 will work in a similar way as Ctrl+N, Ctrl+P in unextended vim so the\nscript can be used without the popup menu.\nF5 in insert mode will lookup the class and display it in a preview window\nThe key mapping are only tested under Windows and linux and they will not\nwork on all platforms. Changing the mappings is easy.\n\nThe plugin is depending on that exuberant ctags has generated a tags file\ncalled cppcomplete.tags with the same options as in the following example:\nctags -n -f cppcomplete.tags --fields=+ai --C++-types=+p *\nThe script has a command called GenerateTags that executes the above ctags\ncommand. The tag file cppcomplete.tags is local to the script so you can\nuse other tag files without affecting cppcomplete. \nJava users do not need the --C++-types flag.\n\nFor C/C++ can the script generate the cppcomplete.tags from the included\nfiles for you. This is based on vims checkpath function. The path must be\nset correct, see the vim documentation.\n\nThis script do not requires grep anymore but it is supported. If the option\nis set to build an internal list with derived classes and the first\ncompletion takes a very long time may grep speed things up. \nFor Windows does the DJGPP  port of grep works. \nYou only need grep.exe from the grep'version'b.zip file.\nA good place for grep.exe could be the compilers bin directory.\nThe zip file is in the v2gnu directory, it can be downloaded from here:\nhttp://www.delorie.com/djgpp/getting.html\n\nIt is possible to define a set of lines from cppcomplete.tags with regular\nexpressions. I call the set for a block. The functions for this:\nBuildBlockFromRegexp the command to build the block, see below.\nNextInBlock jump to the line described in the block, can be called by Shift+F8 \nPrevInBlock same as the above but in the other direction, use Shift+F9\nEchoBlock shows the block itself\nBuildMenuFromBlock builds a menu in GUI mode from the block\nThe jumps are done with an internal function so the tag stack will not be\naffected.\n\nSome simple examples there > is the prompt:\n>class:l\nGives a block with all members that has a scope of a class beginning with l\n>^a.*\\ts\\t\nall structures beginning with an a\n>^\\(a\\|b\\|c)\nEverything that starts with a,b or c\nThe full vim history mechanism can be used.\n\nThe script has a number of variables that can be set from the menu in the \nGUI or wildmenu versions. They are at the top of the script file with descriptions if\nyou want to change them more permanent.\n\nFor Java do you probably want to generate a cppcomplete.tags file from the\nsources of the Java SDK. The use is like with C/C++ but you will get a\nbetter result if you change some of the configuration variables.\nThe default access is treated as if it was public. \n\nIf you are new to vim and have not heard about ctags, regexp, grep are they\nall described in the online documentation. Just type :help followed by the word you\nwant more information about. They are excellent tools that can be used for\nmany things.\n\n\nBUGS/Features\nThis plugin does not really understand any C/C++ code, it is not a real parser.\nIt works surprisingly well but can of course give a surprising result. :)\nThe current scope is unknown.\nMultidimensional arrays should not have a space between ][, e.g.\nxyz[1][2].abc should be OK but not xyz[1] [2].abc\nThe script does not accept functions, e.g. xyc()->abc will not be completed or rather\nit will be completed but from all names beginning with abc.\n(GTK) If the mouse leaves and then reenters the popup menu is the text cursor affected.\n(GTK) The popup is displayed at the mouse position and not the text cursor position.\nFor internal use is register c used.\nRequires exuberant ctags.\nThe only tested platforms for the popup menu are GTK (linux) and Windows.\n+ probably a lot of other issues\n\nAnyway, I have done some testing with MFC, DX9 framework (not COM), Java SDK, STL with\ngood results.\n",
