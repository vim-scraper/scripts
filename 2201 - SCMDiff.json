  "description": "This script is a modification of the script posted here:\nhttp://tekrat.com/2008/02/21/vim-diff/\n\nIt allows you to quickly toggle (through a keybinding, Ctrl-D by default) the highlighting of changed lines in a file through an SCM's diff command.\n\nIt also binds Ctrl-G to :set nodiff to quickly turn off the highlighting.\n\nThe original script was written for git, but this version works for (at least) Mercurial and Subversion as well.  CVS and Perforce likely work but have not been tested.\n\nIt likely only works on Unix systems, or at least systems with 'cat' and 'patch', in addition to the SCM's command.\n\nConfiguration consists of the variable g:SCMDiffCommand, which if not set will be set to 'svn', assuming Subversion.  If g:SCMDiffCommand is set to 'hg', it works for Mercurial, and likewise 'git' for git.",
