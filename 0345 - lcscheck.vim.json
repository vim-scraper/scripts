  "description": "Under utf-8, characters 128 and over become multi-byte. Therefore, under  Vim 6.1 or earlier, they should not be used for the option values in 'listchars'. This script takes care of the \"eol:\" sub-option, the only one which gave me problems. If you use characters >= 128 for other sub-options, similar scripts can easily be written (based on this one) to take care of them.\n\nThis script has intentionally been abundantly commented to make it understandable.\n\nSee vimtip#246 for a related tip.",
