  "description": "Provides word count for manuscripts (essay or story documents), compliant with standard author rules (such as Strunk & White style lexicon for English grammar).\n\nStandard word count utilities (like unix 'wc') do not provide an accurate count because they count breaks between words.  In fiction writing, some sentences--like this one--have more words than breaks between words..\n\nTo use, install and type :WC\n\nLine ranges are supported.\n\nTo count the lines of a particular section of a document, insert a new line with 8 dashes, and the count will stop at that line.\n--------\nLike that.\n\nThe word count also ignores the common author mark for section breaks using asterisk as shown below.\n \n* * * \n\nThis script is based on the sed 'wc' example provided in the GNU info pages; the algorithm replaces each whitespace seperated word by a single character and then counts the length of the string.\n\n",
