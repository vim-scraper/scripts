If it is a published post, it will use the \"?p=id\" URL format. Note that this doesn't affect how you have your wordpress default URL slug setup.\n\nYou can configure the plugin to not open a browser window by changing the enable_preview setting to 0. Currently, it will open a new window/tab everytime you do :BlogSend. I hope to modify this to only do it once per post in the future.\n\nI also now show the appropriate url in the Preview line based on whether it is a draft or published post."
