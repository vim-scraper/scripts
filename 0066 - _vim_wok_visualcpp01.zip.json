  "description": "Some key extensions, which simulate MS Visual Studio C++ behaviour under VIM. E.g. CTRL-F2 sets/unsets anonymous marks on current line, F2 jumps to next mark. HOME toggles cursorpos between first column of line and first non-white-char on current line. TAB indents all currently selected lines by one shiftwidth (SHIFT-TAB unindents). CTRL-SPACE does keyword completion.\nEven people who never used (or will use) the MS IDE, these key bindings make some tasks quicker/simpler... Just try the CTRL-F2 / F2 feature and you'll love it. Same for the new HOME behaviour.\nThis is my first VIM script, so don't blame me, if things work in even more simple ways... just drop me an email - and tell me how!",
