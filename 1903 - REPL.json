Empty string means empty string here.\n\" 3) Substitution flags:\n\"     (i) ignorecase (m) matchCase\n\"     (w) as word    (c) confirm    (f) in files\n\"    Default flags are 'mw' - match-case and whole-word substitution.\n\"\n\" If you include f in flags, you are additionally prompted for\n\" file patterns (space-separated). Examples: (1) *.c *.h (2)  **.[ch]\n\" '**' in file patterns means recursive file matching.\n\"\n\" Press Ctrl-C at any prompt to abort the script.\n\"\n\" That's all.\n\" Send bugs and wishes to: iler.ml@gmail.com\n\"\n\" Todo & wishes:\n\" - print \"No substitutions\" when there were no substitutions.
