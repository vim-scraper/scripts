  "description": "Requires:\n- ctags 5.7 or greater\n- PERL (just PERL, you don't need to have Vim compiled with PERL support)\n- FSwitch Vim utility (vimscript #2590)\n\nCheck out the video demo at: http://www.vimeo.com/4448265\n\nYou've got a C++ header file and you've got some prototypes declared in there.  Now you need to create some definitions in a C++ implementation file.  What do you do?  Yank and paste?  Naw :)  Use this plugin instead...\n\nThe concept is pretty simple: while in the implementation file, you hit a key and all of the currently undefined function prototypes in the header file are automatically pulled in to the implementation file and inserted at the current cursor position.\n\n- Pure virtual functions are ignored\n- Functions that are already defined in the header file are ignored\n- Free functions are brought in\n- Class name is automatically prefixed to member functions\n- Constructors and Destructors sort first\n- Only the missing items are pulled in so you can use this utility to bring the implementation file up to match the contents of the header file\n- However you format the prototype shouldn't really make a difference.  ProtoDef endeavours to reduce all declarations to a canonical form.\n\n",
