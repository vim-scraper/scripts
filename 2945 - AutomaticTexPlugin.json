A bug fixed in search function which makes both function work twice as fast. \n* BibSearch: If there are no flags given but only keyword flags BibSearch uses the default g:defaultbibflags.\n* BibSearch: speed up: search function is up to 5 times faster, when no arguments are supplied (which for example when completing '\\cite{'). The function which shows results is now 3 times faster. For a file which has ~1700 bib fields it takes ~10 seconds to show all results. \n* BibSearch: a flag 'k' added for lines 'key = {...}' in a bib file.\n* IMAPs are CHANGED!, there are no imaps with [, only with ], which makes it more convenient to write latex optional arguments. If you want to use old maps put: \"let g:atp_env_maps_old=1\" in your vimrc file. See \":h atp-mappings-environments\".\n* Small Changes in the menu.

Environments may be NESTED. See &#039:h atp-completion&#039. There are two modes of completion: expert mode (mapped to <Tab>) and non expert mode (mapped to  <Shift>+<Tab>), the first with fewer matches of commands, the second if you are searching for some command.  Completion of commands checks if you are in math mode (only if entire document is written without $:$ and $$:$$ math modes, as it is hard to implement such a feature for this opening/closing pairs.). You can switch it on/off in the menu. Completion supports: commands, inline_math (automatically closes &#039\\\\(&#039), displayed_math (closes &#039\\\\[&#039), package names, tikz libraries (for the tikz package), environment names, close, labels, bibitems (for \\\\cite and \\\\nocite commands), environments, names of input files (searches for file names under b:outdir and g:texmfdir), bibfiles.\n* Wrap selection due to D. Munger (thanks!).\nThe following are yet in the help file:\n* The status line notification that tex is working (you need to set g:atp_status_notification=1 and g:atp_callback=1), by default is off (this changes mode from input to normal when tex ends). \n* Debug mode: you can set g:atp_show_errors=1 (and g:atp_callback=1) by default is off. You can open the log file (using :copen), and after tex ends the log file will be reread and the log will be updates.
