  "description": "PreciseJump aka '[count] motion' on drugs\n\nI find\n    <number>line-motion\nnot very practical for bigger <numbers>.\n\nI usually don't know exactly how many times I want the motion to be repeated - I just see place on the screen where I want to jump to.\n\nThis script is addressing this inconvenience.\n\nWhen the motion key is pressed, possible jump targets are highlighted. You just have to type character that appeared on desired place.\n\ni.e: If you press new '_fx' you get all 'x' characters in the line highlighted and changed to\nsome unique chars. Pressing the highlighted char will take the cursor to place you want.\n\nFor little demo you can see:\nhttp://i258.photobucket.com/albums/hh246/otokan/WATCH_ME.gif\n\nPlugin definines following mapping:  _f ,  _w ,  _e ,  _t . \n\nThis script is usable right now, but keep in mind that it still is being developed. \nI would appreciate any comments.\n",
