  "description": "Follows is an adaption of sqlplus.vim written by Jamis Buck see http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=97\nfor the original. \n\nThis script contains code required to execute SQL queries from withing VIM.  It uses sqsh (http://www.sqsh.org/) however it could trivially be adapted to use isql.  It is very ruff and ready but seems to offer required functionality.\n\nThanks to Jamis Buck for creating sqlplus.vim I am sure if you compair the code you will see how little I have had to do to get this code to work ;-) \n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n============\n\nEdit ~/.sqshrc and add the line \\set semicolon_hack=1 \n\nSave the code into a file and source from your .vimrc or use your favourate autoload system.\n\nEdit the code to add the credentials for the databases you would like to connect to.\n\nIn highlight mode hit F8 to execute the hightlighed SQL.  It will cope with broken lines.\n\nHit F8 with no highlighted selection and VIM will prompt you for a database to connect to.\n\n",
