  "description": "I usually edit Python code that has a lot of whitespace indenting.\nThe backspace key works nicely, and I'm able to delete indents,\nbut I'm unable to do so with the <Del> key.\nI've searched the web, searched the scripts and tips, asked on the vim mailing list,\nasked on IRC and read a lot of documentation.\nIn the end, I found it easier to write a Python script that gave me the desired behaviour.\nSo, here it is. It works for me.",
  "install_details": "(for *nix)\nNote that you need Python-support compiled in to your Vim.\n(On Debian, just apt-get install vim-python)\nSave the script to your .vim/indent folder.\nAdd these two lines to your .vimrc:\ninoremap <silent> <Del> <ESC>:pyfile ~/.vim/indent/delete.py<CR>i\nnnoremap <silent> <Del> :pyfile ~/.vim/indent/delete.py<CR>\n",
