  "description": "Provides context sensitive word lookup. The manuals in vimhelp format that are not \nrelated to Vim can be kept in separate locations with separate tagfiles.\n\nThe context sensitive lookup is implemented by the plugin vxlib/context.vim. When a \nmanual lookup is required (mapped to K), the plugin checks the context the cursor is \nin - the current filetype and the current syntax element. Then it finds all the help \nproviders that were registered for the detected context. The highest scored provider \nis executed an the results are displayed. It is also possible to display a list of \nproviders applicable in the current context and select one (\\km); if vimuiex is \ninstalled, a popup list will be displayed, otherwise the choices are echoed to the \nscreen and the uesr enters a choice.\n\nExample: when you're editing Python kode and press K on a keyword, an entry from the \nPython documentation will be displayed (the output from pydoc). When the cursor is in \na Python comment or a string, dict will be used instead. Similarly, when editing \nHTML, help for CSS can be displayed when the cursor is in the <style> section.\n\nThere are three possible types of results a provider can produce: \n   t - show help text for keyword\n   k - list similar keywords (and find help for the selected one)\n   g - grep the manuals to find occurences of the word\n\nThe library comes with the following providers (supported types are in parentheses):\n   vimhelp (tkg) - internal vim help\n   extvimhelp (tkg) - external help in vimhelp format, stored in a separate location\n   man (t) - unix man\n   pydoc (tg) - python documentation, requires pydoc program\n   pydiction (k) - uses the dictionary produced by vimscript#850\n   cmakeref (tkg) - vimscript#3045, uses extvimhelp\n   cssref (tkg) - vimscript#918, uses extvimhelp\n   crefvim (tkg) - vimscript#614, vimscript#2353, uses extvimhelp\n   luarefvim (tkg) - vimscript#1291, uses extvimhelp\n   dict (t) - find a dictionary entry using the dict program\n\nThe providers that use extvimhelp expect the manuals to be installed in the location \nset in g:vxlib_manuals_directory. Initially this location is set to ~/.vim/manuals \n(actually the script takes the first item from &rtp and appends /manuals to it). Each \nmanual is stored in a subdirectory of this location, the name of the subdirectory is \nthe same as the name of the provider, eg.\n   ~/.vim/manuals/cmakeref\n   ~/.vim/manuals/luarefvim\n\nAfter you install each manual, don't forget to run :helptags %:p:h on a file from \nthe manual.\n",

Set 'generate=0' in section [manuals#maps]. An \nalternative is to edit ~/.vimrc and add\n   let g:vxenable_manuals_maps=0",
