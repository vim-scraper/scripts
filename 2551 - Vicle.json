  "description": "Vim - Interpreter Command Line Editor. Use vim like a front-end for edit commands and send it to an interactive interpreter open in a GNU Screen session.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Command History, just like a shell\n- History save/load\n- Can send only selected text or custom selection\n\nI have been using Python, Ruby, Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Ksh, and others interpreters through Vim and Vicle (and GNU Screen, of course).\n\nUsage:\n\n- Load a Screen session and then load an interpreter (ipython, irb, shell,\n  sbcl, clisp, clojure,  etc.) in the shell:\n  % screen -S rubySession\n  % irb\n  >>\n\n- Open Vim with the vicle plugin and type a command (without press ENTER):\n  puts \"Ruby interpreter\"\n\n- Type <C-c><C-c>  or <C-CR> or :VicleSend  to send to the interpreter the\n  current line (that can be changed by setting other Selection String).\n\n- If the identifiers of the screen are not set, you are going be asked for\n  it (put the session name and window number where your interpreter are.\n  All the windows in a Screen session have a unique number.\n  You can use TAB key for completion in the Session name):\n\n  Session name: rubySession\n  Window number: 0\n\n  In the screen window you are going to see:\n  >> puts \"Ruby interpreter\"\n  Ruby interpreter\n  => nil\n\n  If you disable the Edition Mode by calling the command :VicleEditionToggle\n  the <C-CR> and the other shortcut are going to send all the content of the\n  screen and after that, the screen of Vim are going to be cleared, just\n  like a normal command line.\n\n- You scroll through the commands with the key <C-Up> and <C-Down>   just\n  like the history of the shell.\n\n- Edition Mode\n  This mode do not clear the screen after send the command. Also, it send a\n  command selected by a custom Selection String that is in the variable\n\n  w:vicle_selection_string\n\n  Edition Mode is 1 (ON) by default.\n\n  By default, vicle in Edition mode send the current line.\n  Toggle the Edition Mode using the command :VicleEditionToggle\n\n  The selection string is by default \"0v$y\": go to column 0, enter visual\n  mode, go to the end of line and yank. Always is necesary to end with the\n  yank command \"y\".\n  It can be set to \"{v}y\" to select the current paragraph\n\n- Sending selected text using Vim's Visual Mode\n  Just select the text and press <C-CR> or <C-c><C-c> to send the selected\n  text without clear the screen. It is the same in Vicle Edition Mode and\n  Vicle Not Edicion Mode (send command and clear vim screen)\n\n  Just select the text. Vicle are going to yank it.\n\n- Usefull commands for manage the history. Use absolute paths for history files:\n  :VicleHistoryToggle   \" activate or deactivate history\n  :VicleHistoryClear\n  :VicleHistorySize\n  :VicleHistorySave\n  :VicleHistoryLoad\n\n- To change the screen name and window name use the command\n  :VicleSession\n\n- Some global variables that you can define in your .vimrc:\n\n  let g:vicle_session_name    = 'normal_session_name'\n  let g:vicle_session_window  = 'normal_session_window'\n\n  let g:vicle_history_active   = 0 \" deactivate history\n  let g:vicle_edition_mode     = 1 \" active edition mode\n  let g:vicle_selection_string = \"0v$y\"  \" yank current line\n\n  let g:vicle_hcs             = '~~~your_command_separator~~~'\n\nTips:\n\n- If you want to send commands to a Ruby interpreter (irb), open a file like\n  work.rb or other with the extension .rb  or set the filetype manually\n  :set filetype=ruby\n\n This apply to other languages supported by vim.\n\n- For use Vicle with diferent languages\n\n  autocmd FileType python let w:vicle_selection_string = \"0v}y\"\n  autocmd FileType lisp let w:vicle_edition_mode = 1 | let w:vicle_history_active = 0 | let w:vicle_selection_string = \"v%y\"\n\n- Use of rlwrap to run the interpreter\n\n  It is known that by trying and testing that running the interpreter with rlwrap improves the performances of vicle.\n\n  Clojure with rlwrap:\n  screen -S clojure rlwrap java -cp clojure.jar clojure.main\n\n- About the limit of size for the buffers to send\n\n  Vicle call many times to Screen when the buffer to send its bigger than 1000 characters. This let vicle to send really big buffers.\n\n\nInspired On:\n\n  Slime for Vim from Jonathan Palardy\n  http://technotales.wordpress.com/2007/10/03/like-slime-for-vim/\n  and the work of Jerris Welt\n  http://www.jerri.de/blog/archives/2006/05/02/scripting_screen_for_fun_and_profit/\n",
