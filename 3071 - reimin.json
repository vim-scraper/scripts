  "description": "Usually adding an #include to a C or C++ source file means jumping the cursor to a line near the top of the file, adding the include, and jumping back. I consider jumping away from where the cursor is right now a distracting act, and thus the raison d&#039Ãªtre of this plugin.\n\nIn normal mode enter :IncludeLocal or :IncludeSystem. You will be prompted for an include: enter the header name with no double quotes or angle-brackets.\n\nThe latest code is at http://github.com/wilhelmtell/reimin, but I will do my best to sync Vim Scripts when I make any significant release.",
