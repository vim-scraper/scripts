  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "DESCRIPTION:\n  Indent commands like >>, << and <C-T>/<C-D> in insert mode indent the entire\n  line. For some kinds of comments, like the big boilerplate at the file\n  header etc., the comment prefix (e.g. # for Perl scripts) should remain at\n  the first column, though. \n  This plugin modifies these indent commands so that the comment prefix\n  remains in the first column, and the indenting takes place between the\n  comment prefix and the comment text. For that, it uses the comment\n  configuration provided by the buffer's 'comment' option, which is set by\n  most filetype plugins. \n\nUSAGE:\n  On a line like this:\n  # My comment. \n  The >> command now keeps the # prefix in column 1, and just indents the\n  comment text:\n  #       My comment. \n  This only works if there is at least one whitespace character after the\n  prefix (so that comments like ###### do not become #       ######). \n  Progressive de-indenting will remove all whitespace between prefix and\n  comment text, or leave a single space in between if the 'comments' setting\n  requires a blank after the comment prefix. \n\n  An optional [count] of lines can be supplied to the >> and << commands, as\n  before.\n  In visual mode, the optional [count] specifies how many 'shiftwidth's should\n  be indented; the > and < commands operate on all highlighted lines. \n\n  With the optional repeat.vim script, the commands can also be repeated via '.'. \n  \n  The same behavior is available in insert mode via the <C-T>/<C-D> mappings. \n\n  In case you want to indent lines including the comment prefix, the original\n  indent behavior is mapped to 'g>>' in normal mode and 'g>' in visual mode.\n  (There's no need for the corresponding g<< dedent mappings, just stop\n  dedenting when the comment prefix reaches column 1.)\n  Alternatively, you could also use the >{motion} command, as the > and <\n  operators aren't modified by this script. ",
  "install_details": "INSTALLATION:\n  Put the script into your user or system VIM plugin directory (e.g.\n  ~/.vim/plugin). \n\nDEPENDENCIES:\n  - Requires VIM 7.0 or higher. \n  - vimscript #2136 repeat.vim autoload script (optional)\n\nCONFIGURATION:\n  If you don't want the alternative g>> mappings for the original indent\n  commands, set the following variable _before_ sourcing this script (e.g. in\n  your vimrc file (see :help vimrc)). \n\tlet g:IndentCommentPrefix_alternativeOriginalCommands = 0\n",
