  "description": "After getting sick of unreadable color schemes because of OS X's Terminal.app color rendition I decided to make my own scheme. The focus is on providing readable combinations of colors.\n\nThis may also look okay in other terminals, but I haven't really tested it there so far.\n\nCurrently it does nothing special for Gvim.\n\nIf you would like to leave comments or make suggestions for this color scheme, please visit my blog: http://kamilkisiel.blogspot.com/2008/11/enzymevim-terminalapp-friendly-color.html",
