  "install_details": "You must have the xmlwf utility on your system.  I believe it is part of the Expat library.  Copy the file to your compiler directory, usually ~/.vim/compiler/.  To use it, open an xml file and type \":compiler xmlwf\".\nThen, \":make\".  It should take you directly to the first error in the document, if there are any.  Note: the xmlwf.vim file has UNIX line endings, so if you get a bunch of garbage when you try to use it on a windows machine (via cygwin, perhaps) just save the file with DOS line endings.",
