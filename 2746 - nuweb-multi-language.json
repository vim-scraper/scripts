  "description": "Almost entirely derived from by Patricio Toledo's original syntax file (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=543) which highlits NUWEB scraps without any language-dependent syntax highlighting. I modified it in the following ways:\n1) Scraps beginning with \"@{/* C */\" will be highlit as C\n2) Scraps beginning with \"@{# Python\" will be highlit as Python.\n3) For all other scraps, the opening \"@{\" must be followed by a newline.\n\nIt's very easy to extend this syntax file to handle other languages. If someone else could fix #3, so that \"@{anything@}\" scraps could work without a newline following \"@{\", I'd appreciate it. Also, other ideas on doing multi-language highlighting are welcome.",
