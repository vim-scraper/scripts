  "description": "NOTE:as of  june 17, 2003, this script is no more developped due to lack of time/lack of certain features i miss in ctags. i'll take patches to improve it however, and i have a much more ambitious version (with limited lex/yacc parsing in ruby via racc) on my hard-drive, any contribution is appreciated.\ni don't consider it dead, but in hibernation (especially for the ctags features).\n\nREQUIRES RUBY.\nThis plugin will provide functions to get \"code completion\" in vim.\nit will list all methods for the identifier under the cursor if you call :PossibleFunctions.\nwhen you start typing a method, it will tell you which methods of the relevant class start by what you typed if you call :PossibleCompletions.\nit works by using gd and ctags to get the class of the relevant object, and ctags to get the list of functions for this object.\nNOTE: this includes inheritance! functions of the class and the parent classes are listed.\nnormally also only public member functions are listed.\nThis plugin requires tags to be generated with certain parameters (it\n needs information about inheritance and access of members).\n You can use the GenerateTags command to generate tags for the current directory.\n\nFor now this plugin only supports Java and C++. It should only support OO languages, though I guess it could be used for C structs maybe.",
