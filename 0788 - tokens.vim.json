  "summary": "Use tokens (input()) to extend abbreviations",
  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "This is fairly rough at the moment but what it does is allow tokens within abbreviations that you will be prompted to replace. These are based on the following digraphs:\n\n<C-K>Cu    -  if you use this token you will be prompted at every occurence\n                    \n<C-K>MW  -  you will only be prompted once and every subsequent use\n                        of this token will be the input you entered.\n\n<C-K>TH    -  Place this where you'd like the cursor to end up.\n                        This is a bit buggy at the moment so any comments  \n                         are welcomed.\n\n<C-K><< and >>  -  If you want to provide a message as to what you're\n                                  replacing use these. The only stipulation is that the \n                                  message be exactly 15 chars including << and >>\n\n<C-K>',    -   Because this plugin uses liblist.vim, commas need to be \n                     entered using this digraph.\n\n                ***   Requires:  liblist.vim   ***\nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=166\n\nThe mapping used is <leader>et\n\nReading the script probably explains things better than I'm doing here but here's a few egs. (These are all insert mode by the way)\nEg1\n     type   dic\n     hit <leader>et\n     you'll see the prompt  <<   class name  >>\n     type in foo and hit <CR>\n     the string   <div class=\"foo\">|</div>   will be inserted with the cursor at the pipe.\n(this uses the 'Cu','<<>>' and 'TH' digraphs)\nEg2\n     type hd\n     hit <leader>et\n     you'll see the prompt  <<header level?>>\n     type in 2 and hit <CR>\n     the string <h2>|</h2> will be inserted again with the cursor at the pipe\n(this uses the 'MW','<<>>' and 'TH' digraphs)    \n\nKnown issues:\n    For some reason you can't place the 'TH' digraph at the end of the string. It  executes once OK but then stops.\n\n\nAs I'm not a programmer this could more than likely do with a complete overhaul. If anybody would like to help out or make suggestions, email markwoodwardATbigpond.com. I'd appreciate some input as I think the ideas pretty impressive but my executions not ;-)\n     ",
