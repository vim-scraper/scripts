  "description": "The most convenient way to navigate currently opened buffers.\n\nDefault hot key is F3.\n\nInitially, QuickName display the full list of opened buffers in a compact way (multi-column) inside command area. As you type, QuickName narrows the list to only buffers with matched name. Hit <Enter> to open selected buffer. Hit <Esc> or hot key (default F3) again to close QuickName.\n\nWhen QuickName is active, arrow keys and backspace function as expected.\n\nMatching rule: thefile.vim can be matched with any of thefil, thefi.vim, thfl.vm. Guess why!\n\nShould QuickName integrate with QuickBuf, and how?\nAny ideas and bug reports, please send to palnart@gmail.com.\n",
