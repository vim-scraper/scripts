I'm putting it online just in case somebody wants exactly what's there, if you're just browsing, you should probably skip this version.\n\nStarting with 2 utils:\n\n1. Count the no. of occurences of a -PERL- regex in a range ( :<range>Count <regex>)\n2. Insert a timestamp, formatted according to a time-format string at the current cursor position in the command mode ( <Leader>t) where <Leader> is usually '&#039\n3. Comment a block of C-code by selecting a range and hitting <Leader>C - it replaces /* and */ inside with {{{ and }}} to cope with nested comments.\n\n",
