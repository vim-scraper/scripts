  "description": "# simplenote.vim\nA vim plugin to interact with the [simplenote][1] API.\nNow you can take simple notes directly from your favourite editor.\n\n## Installation\nJust copy `simplenote.vim` into your plugin folder. But you really want to use\n[pathogen][5] for your plugin management.\n\nYour credentials have to be stored in your `vimrc`:\n\n    let g:SimpleNoteUserName = \"your simplenote username\"\n    let g:SimpleNotePassword = \"your simplenote password\"\n\n## Usage\nThe plugin provides the following commands to interact with Simplenote:\n\n    SimpleNote -l\n\nLists all the notes in your account, together with its first line.\n\n    SimpleNote -d\n\nDeletes the note in your current buffer.\n\n    SimpleNote -u\n\nUpdates the note in the current buffer with its content.\n\n## Dependencies\nVersion 2 of the SimpleNote API relies heavily on JSON. As JSON and VimL don't\nreally play nice together, basic parts of this plugin are implemented in\npython. Therefore your vim has to be compiled with python support in order to\nuse this plugin.\n\n## Development\n- [Planned features](http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/288621)\n- [Bugs and issue tracker](https://github.com/mrtazz/simplenote.vim/issues)\n\n## Contribute\n- Fork the project\n- Make your additions/fixes/improvements (Bonus points for topic branches)\n- Send a pull request\n\n## Thanks\n[mattn][2], [Tim Pope][3] and [Scrooloose][4] who write awesome vim plugins\nwhich I took as a basis to learn how to write vim plugins.\n\n[1]: http://simplenoteapp.com/\n[2]: http://github.com/mattn\n[3]: http://github.com/tpope\n[4]: http://github.com/scrooloose\n[5]: http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen",
