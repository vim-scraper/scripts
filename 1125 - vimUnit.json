  "description": "  PURPOSE:\n\t\tTo provide vim scripts with a simple unit testing framework and tools.\n\t\tThe framework and tools should resemble JUnit's interface definitions\n\t\tto ease usage of both frameworks (and others based on JUnit). \n\t\tObviously vim scripts are not java so I will only try to implement the\n\t\tstuff useful to vim scripts. As a first milestone I think the \n\t\tjunit.Assert and junit.TestResult classes to get a vim-script\n\t\tunit-testing environment going.\n\t\t\n  WHY:\n \t\tWell, I have been working on some vim-scripts and read a lot of them\n \t\tthe last two weeks and I really, really miss my unit-test (and\n \t\tmock-object, but that is fare fetched I think..:O) tools to get my own\n \t\tstuff of the ground (and making modifications to your's).\n \t\t\n  THOUGHTS:\n\t\tWriting unit-test code against a UI environment is often very difficult \n\t\tor demanding to creative solutions to be productive. We would like to \n\t\thave a mock-object framework to go with the unit-testing framework.\n\t\t\n  INSTALLATION:\n  \t\tPlace this file in your plugin directory (~/.vim/ftplugin/)\n  \t\tWhen you start vim again and open a vim file for editing you should\n  \t\tget a message that vimUnit has installed its documentation.\n  \t\tTo get you started you could try :h vimUnit or :h VUAutoRun\n  \t\t\n  TIPS:\n  \t\tDocumentation (when written..:o) is found at the bottom of this file. \n  \t\tThanks to code from vimspell.vim it should be self-installing the first\n  \t\ttime this module is loaded\n\n  \t\tIf your new to test-first principles and thinking you should start\n  \t\twith the article: \n  \t\t\thttp://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm\n  \t\tAnd then surf the web on these locations:\n  \t\t\thttp://www.junit.org/\n  \t\t\thttp://xprogramming.com/\n  \t\t\thttp://www.extremeprogramming.org/\n \n  NOTE:\n\t\t8 Nov 2004 (v 0.1) This is my initial upload. The module is fare \n\t\tfrom finished. But as I could do with some input from other vim users\n\t\tSo I have chosen to let people know I'm working on it. \n\n\t\tTo be conform with vim-script naming conventions functions are\n\t\tprepended with VU (VimUnit). So stuff you would normaly would call \n\t\tVUAssert are called VUAssert, TestRunner* are called VURunner and so on.\n\t\tGlobal variables starts with vimUnit*\n\t\t\n\n  Best Regards\n  Staale Flock,  (staale -- lexholm .. no)",
