  "description": "____________________________________________________________\nOverview\n\nThe plugin eui_vim concerns the use of a text editor as the user\ninterface to applications:  the \"Editable User Interface\".\n\nIt presents an alternative to incorporating applications into the\ntext editor as a tightly bound, monolithic product and to\nresisting any integration of the text-editor with other\napplications for non-text-editing functions.  \n\nThe conceptualization of the ''Editable User Interface'' helps\ndefine and delimit the role of the text editor in facilitating the\nuse of diverse applications.  In such a role, the text editor is\ndelimited to being an interface only, i.e., in regard to support\nof non-text-editing tasks, it is delimited to \n\n  * rendering user input,\n  * transferring user commands and data to the external application,\n  * responding to (text-editing) commands from the external application and\n  * rendering the external application's output to the user.  \n\n(In the above, rendering refers to display of text.)\n\nAs a specific example of the abstraction \"Editable User Interface\", \nthe code presented here, eui_vim.vim and eui_vim.pl illustrate how \none can use the Vim editor as an user interface to other applications.\n\n____________________________________________________________\nValue\n\nMost of the value of this plugin lies in the ideas expounded \nin eui_vim.txt or in http://www.sonic.net/~suresh/eui/ \n(and, perhaps, by way of the comments in the .vim and .pl code).\n\n____________________________________________________________\nTable of Contents of eui_vim.txt\n\nIntroduction\n  Graphical, Keyboard and Pseudo-keyboard User Interfaces\n  Editable User Interface\n    The Text Editor\n    The PC as a Product\nUsers' Guide\n  Preliminaries\n    System Requirements\n    Download\n    Installation\n  Tutorial\n    :EUIProcess foo\n    :EUIProcess list\n    :EUIProcess demo_plot\n    How the transfers are done\n      Format of the fifo-file\n    :EUIProcess quit\n    Automatic clean-up\nExample Applications\n  VimPuppy\n  Vimms\nAuthor\nClaims\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\n\n",

  "install_details": "____________________________________________________________\nSystem Requirements\n\nEui_vim has been tested on Windows 98 with the ''Big version with\nGUI'' Vim 6.2 (requires +clientserver, but perl support is not\nrequired).  It is unlikely to work as-is on unix (the port to \nunix is likely to be simpler).\n\n____________________________________________________________\nInstallation\n\nEssentially, unzip eui_vim.zip into the vimfiles directory while\npreserving folder names and regenerate the help-tags.  \n\nUnzipping deploys three files:  \n\n    vimfiles\\plugin\\eui_vim.vim,\n    vimfiles\\perl\\eui_vim.pl     and \n    vimfiles\\doc\\eui_vim.txt \n\nThe help-tags can be regenerated, for example, by executing\n\":helptags $vim\\vimfiles\\doc\" from within vim.\n\nIn systems that don't have perl, eui_vim.pl can be replaced by a\nself-contained executable, eui_vim.exe available from the author.\n\n",
