  "description": "Screenshot:\nhttp://eclim.org/_images/screenshots/vim/gnu_screen_shell.png\n\nThis plugin aims to simulate an embedded shell in vim by allowing you to easily\nconvert your current vim session into one running in gnu screen (or tmux) with\na split gnu screen window containing a shell, and to quickly send statements /\ncode to whatever program is running in that shell (bash, python, irb, etc.).\nSpawning the shell in your favorite terminal emulator is also supported for\ngvim users or anyone else that just prefers an external shell.\n\nCurrently tested on Linux and Windows (win32 gvim and cygwin vim), but\nshould also work on any unix based platform where screen is supported\n(OSX, BSD, Solaris, etc.).\n\nWindows Users: Whether you are using gvim or not, you will need cygwin\ninstalled with cygwin's bin directory in your windows PATH.\n\nYou can also find this screen plugin in my vimfiles github repository:\nhttp://github.com/ervandew/screen\n\nCommands:\n  :ScreenShell [cmd] - Starts a screen hosted shell performing the\n    following steps depending on your environment.\n\n    When running a console vim on a unix based OS (Linux, BSD, OSX):\n      1. save a session file from your currently running vim instance\n         (current tab only)\n      2. start gnu screen with vim running in it\n      3. load your saved session file\n      4. create a lower gnu screen split window and start a shell, or if\n         g:ScreenShellExternal is set, start an external terminal with\n         screen running.\n      5. if a command was supplied to :ScreenShell, run it in the new\n         shell.\n         Ex. :ScreenShell ipython\n\n      Note: If you are already in a gnu screen session, then only steps\n            4 and 5 above will be run.\n\n    When running gvim:\n      1. start an external terminal with screen running.\n      2. if a command was supplied to :ScreenShell, run it in the new\n         shell.\n         Ex. :ScreenShell ipython\n\n  :ScreenSend - Send the visual selection or the entire buffer contents to\n    the running gnu screen shell window.\n\nAn example workflow may be:\n  Open a python file to work on:\n    $ vim something.py\n\n  Decide you want to run all or pieces of the code in an interactive\n  python shell:\n    :ScreenShell python\n\n  Send code from a vim buffer to the shell:\n    :ScreenSend\n\n  Quit the screen session and return to your original vim session:\n    :ScreenQuit\n      or\n    :qa\n",
