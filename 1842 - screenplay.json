  "description": "The definition of a well formatted screenplay (as I understand it) goes\nsomething like:\n\n<15 spaces>SCENE/ACTION/DESCRIPTIONS (max 54 chars before wrapping)\n<37 spaces>CHARACTER NAME\n<25 spaces>DIALOG (max 35 chars before wrapping)\n\nIt might look like:\n\n\n             EXT. CITY STREET - DAY\n\n             Rain pissing down. Newspaper KID on street. A man stops\n             to listen.\n\n                                   KID\n                             (shouting)\n                       Extra! Extra! Child labour used to\n                       sell newspapers!\n\nFeatures\n========\n\n * All text is just a tab away from being indented correctly.\n   The tab button and the backspace button have been modified to go\n   backwards and forwards in helpful chunks  \n   Action  == 16 spaces == 1 tab\n   Dialog  == 26 spaces == 2 tabs\n   Speaker == 38 spaces == 3 tabs\n\n * The textwidth (tw) variable switches from 68 to 60, when moving from\n   ACTION to DIALOG. This ensures good margins.\n\n * Control-p will re-format a paragraph from under the cursor\n   downwards, relative to the (textwidth) margin\n\n * When you tab three times to type in a character name for DIALOG, and you\n   type the first letter of the characters name and then tab again, then you\n   will be presented with a choice to autocomplete that characters name.\n   (provided you've typed that characters name above a DIALOG at least once\n   before).\n  \n * Hitting enter after DIALOG should align for a new character name  \n\n * Hitting enter twice after DIALOG should align for new ACTION block\n",
