  "description": "Ever held visual bell on and thought \"gee, that doesn't look too bad?\" then spent hours inverting your colourscheme by hand to make a new one?\nWell, stop wasting time.  Just pipe the colourscheme through this here funky perl script, and save the output as your new scheme.  It takes a whole 0.035 seconds to run on a 433Mhz Celeron.  This amounts to a considerable (~102857) amount of time saving!\nIt will recognise both RGB and system colour names and do its best to invert them.\nNOTE: it will break on colourscheme files where the highlight commands span multiple lines.  Maybe I'll fix that someday, but then again maybe not.  Feel free to upload a new version which does that.",
  "install_details": "save it, edit it to your liking, run it through your perl interpreter.  I don't use any weird-arse CPAN modules so you don't need anything else.",
