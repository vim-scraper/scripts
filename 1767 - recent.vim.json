  "description": "Former recentern.vim\nInspired by vimscript #1228\n\nRecent.vim keeps track of files you have _written_ recently.  This is useful\nto continue work on files that are scattered around the file system.\n\nThe list of filenames is persistently stored in ~/.vim/recent_files\n\nPer default, the filelist shows up at startup if no other file (or session) is loaded.\nAlso a menu with commands gets installed.  You can turn these things off.\n\nTo open a file of the list, several commands and options are provided to make\nuse of windows and tabpages.\n\nDetails can be found in the help file.\n\nMisc:\n- if there is a window for a file, it is always reused (first one found in\n  any tabpage), currently not customizable\n- files can be ignored based on autocmd-pattern\n- filenames can be highlighted based on extension\n- the file list is only updated when necessary",
