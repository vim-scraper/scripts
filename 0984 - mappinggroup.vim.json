  "description": "This plugin allows you to map function keys to perform different tasks: running a normal command, calling a function, or call a function that will load a new set of mappings.  The plugin supports multilevel key mapping function keys such that after loading a new set of key mappings, it's possible to go back to the previous configuration of function key mappings.\n\nIt is useful to help loading different key map configurations, and also good for key mapping not so frequently used functions.\n",
