  "description": "fork of the famous https://github.com/msanders/snipmate.vim, \nhttp://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2540\nplugin\n\nmy upstream: http://github.com/MarcWebre/snipmate.vim\n\nChanges:\n\n- snippets are loaded lazily as needed and cached. Whenever a file changes they will be reloaded automatically based on timestamps. Thus never reload snippets\n\n- :SnipMateOpenSnippetFiles command for opening snippet files fast.\n  All sane paths depending on your runtimepath are supported\n\n- when writing .snippets files you can visuall select text and press <cr> which will replace space indentation by tabs in a smart way\n\n- {VISUAL} support which means you can make snippets support surrounding some selected text. Example could be:\n\nsnippet fun\n  fun ${1:name}\n  {VISUAL}\n  endf\n\nthen you can visually select and press tab, then select the snippet and {VIUSAL} will be filled\n\n- because there is a global function returning a list of snippets you can also create snippets on the fly. See example about how to create python function skeletons based on definitions in the current file\n\nI'd like to merge - but I never got valuable feedback from the main author.\nDon't miss the README file in the git repo which also clearly states that maybe XPTemplate is another option. So maybe I'll make XPTemplate read snippet files in the future.\n\nApart from those changes everything should be compatible\n\nI was asked to put my fork here so that people find it.",
  "install_details": "This plugin is depending on other plugin (tlib and a utility library providing file caching) thus I recommend vim-addon-manager to install it.\n\nEg :ActivateAddon snipmate\n",
