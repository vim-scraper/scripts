  "description": "EasyGrep makes using vimgrep easier.  When using EasyGrep, searching for a word is as easy as typing <leader>vv (v v, not double-u) over the word for which you want to search.  This search can also be accomplished with the :Grep command.\n\nEasyGrep provides three modes in which you can do your searches:\n  All - all files will be searched  (default)\n  Buffers - all files currently open in vim will be searched\n  TrackExt - all files that match the extension of the currently opened file will be searched.  Additionally, this extension can be mapped to a user defined set of extensions that will also be searched (see EasyGrepFileAssociations).\n    For example: when test.cpp is open, files that match any one of *.cpp *.hpp *.cxx *.hxx *.cc *.c *.h will be searched when a search is initiated.\n\nSetting options is easy, simply type <leader>vo or :GrepOptions.  EasyGrep provides a great set of defaults but can also be configured to start up just how you like it; see the script for these options.  Most vimgrep (and grepprg) options are supported.  \n\nFor a screencast of the script in action go here: http://downloads.veryspeedy.net/vim/EasyGrep.gif\n\nFull keymappings and commands:\n\n\n    <Leader>vv  - Grep for the word under the cursor, match all occurences,\n                  like |gstar|\n    <Leader>vV  - Grep for the word under the cursor, match whole word, like \n                  |star|\n    <Leader>va  - Like vv, but add to existing list\n    <Leader>vA  - Like vV, but add to existing list\n\n    <Leader>vr  - Perform a global search search on the word under the cursor\n                  and prompt for a pattern with which to replace it.\n\nIn addition to grepping the word under the cursor, text may be visually\nselected and these mappings may be used analogously to as they are used above.\nVisual selections will automatically be escaped so as not to confuse the\nselection with a regular expression.\n\n    Each of the above commands will search files according to settings\n    controlled by:\n\n    <Leader>vo  - Select the files to search in and set grep options\n\n    :Grep [arg]\n        Search for the specified arg, like <Leader>vv.  When an ! is added,\n        search like <Leader>vV\n\n    :GrepAdd [arg]\n        Search for the specified arg, add to existing file list, as in\n        <Leader>va.  When an ! is added, search like <Leader>vA\n\n    :Replace [target] [replacement]\n        Perform a global search and replace.  The function searches\n        the same set of files a grep for the desired target and opens a dialog to\n        confirm replacement.\n    \n    :ReplaceUndo\n        Undoes the last :Replace operation.  Does not stack successive\n        searches; only the last replace may be undone.  This function may not\n        work well when edits are made between a call to Replace and a call to\n        ReplaceUndo.\n\n    :GrepOptions [arg]\n        Open a window to set grep options.",

Selections are assumed to be literal, whereas explicit commands are assumed to be regular expressions. \nFeature: Removed option g:EasyGrepNoDirectMappings in favor of g:EasyGrepOptionPrefix, which allows the option prefix to be changed. \nBugfix:  The tracked extension would sometimes fail to be updated when switching between buffers \nDocumentation: Split the documentation into its own file; greatly expanded upon its contents. \nChange: Activating a mode that is already activated will no longer deactivate it. \nChange: GrepOptions no longer accepts an argument; use user mode instead. \nChange: Clarified mapping names; custom mappings will need to be reset."
