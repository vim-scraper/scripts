  "description": "Vim plugin and command line tool for running JSLint (http://jslint.com/).\n\nJSLint is a handy tool that spots errors and common mistakes in JavaScript code.\n\nThe source code for jslint.vim is hosted at (http://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim).\n\nThis is alpha software and is under heavy development.\n\n\n Usage\n -----------------------\n\n- This plugin automatically checks the JavaScript source and highlights the\n  lines with errors.\n\n  It also will display more information about the error in the commandline if the curser is\n  in the same line.\n\n- You also can call it manually via `:JSLintUpdate`\n\n- (optional) Add any valid JSLint options to `~/.jslintrc` file, they will be\n  used as global options for all JavaScript files.\n  For example:\n\n        /*jslint browser: true, regexp: true */\n        /*global jQuery, $ */\n\n        /* vim: set ft=javascript: */\n\nTo get a detailed report of any issues in your JavaScript file outside of Vim,\nrun the `bin/jslint` executable in a terminal. For example:\n\n    $ bin/jslint ftplugin/jslint/fulljslint.js\n\nYou can copy `bin/jslint` into for `PATH` for easier access. The executable\nrequires that the Vim plugin is installed and also requires Ruby.\n\nTo disable error highlighting altogether add this line to your `~/.vimrc` file:\n\n    let g:JSLintHighlightErrorLine = 0\n\n\nAlternative Plugins\n---------------------\n\nThere are other plugins for Vim that integrate JavaScript Lint (http://www.javascriptlint.com/).  JavaScript Lint is another JavaScript checker that is similar to JSLint.\n\njsl.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2630) uses Vim's compiler infrastructure making its use consistent with syntax checkers for other languages.\n\njavaScriptLint.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2578) runs the contents of a JavaScript file through JavaScript Lint after the file's buffer is saved and places any warnings in the quickfix error window.\n\n\nCredits\n---------\n\n- Jesse Hallett -- original author\n- Nathan Smith -- Windows compatibility, quickfix integration, better OS X\n  compatibility, support for node.js, and other improvements\n- Travis Jeffery -- Easy plugin installation with rake\n- Sam Goldstein -- Display of problem report for the current line and bug fixes\n- Bryan Chow -- Fixes for formatting issues and typos\n- Jeff Buttars -- Options to remove and to disable error highlighting\n- Rainux Luo -- Support for reading JSLint options from a `~/.jslintrc` file\n- Pascal Hartig -- Support for running jslint with rhino and other updates\n- Martin Schürrer -- Fixing path issues and error handling\n- Nik Graf -- Documentation updates\n- Ian McCracken -- Real-time error checking\n- Luke Smith -- Enhancement of OS X support\n- Michael Smith -- Feature to customize JavaScript executable that is used by\n  setting JS_CMD environment variable\n- Szilágyi Szilveszter -- Fixes for bugs when running in Windows\n\n\nLicense\n---------\n\nCopyright (c) 2008-2010 Jesse Hallett <hallettj@gmail.com>, except where\notherwise noted\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThe Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

  "install_details": "- Make sure you have a JavaScript interpreter installed.  On Linux jslint.vim\n  supports Spidermonkey, Rhino, and node.js.  Spidermonkey or node.js are\n  recommended because Rhino tends to have a long startup time.\n\n  In Ubuntu you can install the Spidermonkey shell with this command:\n\n        $ sudo apt-get install spidermonkey-bin\n\n  Latest Ubuntu versions don't have spidermonkey in the default repositories.\n  You can use rhino instead:\n\n        $ sudo apt-get install rhino\n\n  Or you can find instructions for installing node.js on the node.js website (http://nodejs.org/).\n\n  On Windows you can use `cscript.exe` - which is probably already installed.\n\n  On MacOS X you don't need to install any JavaScript interpreter because one\n  is included with OS X by default.\n\n- If you have rake installed, run:\n\n        $ rake install\n\n  Otherwise copy the directory ftplugin/ into your Vim ftplugin directory.\n  Usually this is `~/.vim/ftplugin/`. On Windows it is `~/vimfiles/ftplugin/`.\n",
