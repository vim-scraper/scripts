If you have difficulties to install this \nplugin or if you use vim 7.0, please make sure to use the current \nversion of vimball (vimscript #1502). You might need to download the \ndevelopment version from the author's website since previous versions of \nvimball had difficulties with certain filenames.\n\nIn the meantime (after I made the first release), there is a second \nsyntax file for bbcode, which you might also want to check out: \nvimscript #2109.\n\n\nAlso available via git\nhttp://github.com/tomtom/vimtlib/tree/master\n",
