  "description": "With this ftplugin you can type \"create table foo (foo_id int);\" and get \"CREATE TABLE foo (foo_id INT);\".  It is based on both sql.vim and the output from postgresql's \\dT command while in psql.  That makes it a tad bit tailored to postgresql, but it will work with any SQL compliant dbms. \n\nI probably won't upload every update I make immediately so the most current version may be found on github.\nhttp://github.com/xenoterracide/sql_iabbr/tree/master\ngit://github.com/xenoterracide/sql_iabbr.git\n\nearlier versions of this plugin are here http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=305 I am unable to contact Michael Brailsford so have forked the script with my changes. Changes have currently amounted to adding reserved words that weren't present.",
