Most importantly, since there isn&#039t a connection to swank and a live lisp instance, you can only complete static keywords from the syntax file. (like syntaxcomplete.vim -- in fact this started out as a quick munging of that file, and still has lots of its code in there) Also, currently only \\\"simple\\\" and \\\"compound\\\" modes work, there is no support for \\\"fuzzy\\\" completion.",
