  "description": "Requires Vim7.\n\nVST is script which makes possible to export text files with simple markup to HTML or LaTeX format or S5 HTML presentation. Script doesn't require any external dependency and will work on any platform Vim7 is available. VST is implementation of reStructuredText.\n\nSupported elements of inline markup:\n\n- emphasised text (italic)\n- strongly emphasised text (bold)\n- hyperlinks (in various syntax forms)\n- custom decorations (among them: sub, sup, big, small)\n\nElements of documents structure:\n\n- paragraphs\n- block quotes\n- ordered lists\n- unordered lists\n- option lists\n- footnotes\n- citations\n- images\n- preformatted text\n- colorized preformatted text (HTML export only)\n- tables\n- admonitions\n- table of contents\n\nAlso bunch of auxiliary commands which should ease writing of document and navigating (folding, text table of contents, lists or declared links, replacements)\n\nLatest version of script:\nhttp://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.zip\n\nHelp file in text form:\nhttp://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.txt\n\nFollowing versions of help file was produced without any modifications to HTML or LaTeX source:\n\nHTML:\nhttp://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.html\n\nLaTeX file exported from vst.txt:\nhttp://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.tex\n\nPDF file produced from vst.tex:\nhttp://skawina.eu.org/mikolaj/vst.pdf\n",
