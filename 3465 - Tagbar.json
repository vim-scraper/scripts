  "description": "Tagbar displays the tags of the current file in a sidebar, similar to vimscript #273. But it has the advantage that it will display them ordered by their scope -- for example, methods and members in languages like C++, Python or Java will be listed under their correct class instead of just under the general categories 'functions' or 'variables'. This gives a more helpful overview of the file.\n\nAdditionally the Tagbar window can be used to quickly jump to tags.\n\nTagbar requires Exuberant ctags (http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) in at least version 5.5 to work.\n\nPlugin homepage with screenshots:\nhttp://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/\n\nCode repository:\nhttps://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar",
  "install_details": "Use the normal Vimball installation method to install Tagbar:\n\n    vim tagbar.vba\n    :so %\n    :q\n\nIf ctags is not installed in one of the directories in your $PATH environment variable you have to set the option g:tagbar_ctags_bin, see the documentation for exact instructions.",

This is especially useful for ftplugins that can now ship with a complete ctags and Tagbar configuration without requiring user intervention. Thanks to Jan Christoph Ebersbach for the suggestion.\n\n- Added autofocus setting by Taybin Rutkin. This will put the cursor in the Tagbar window when it is opened.\n\n- The \"scopes\" field is no longer needed in type definitions, the information is already there in \"scope2kind\". Existing definitions will be ignored.\n\n- Some fixes and improvements related to redrawing and window switching."
