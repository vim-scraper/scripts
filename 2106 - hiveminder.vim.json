Nothing is provided to detect these files if an alternate filename is selected.\n\nThe syntax will also work with the 'braindump' format temporary files generated when you run todo.pl with the 'braindump' option.  There's no easy way to detect these, but I've hacked my todo.pl to inform vim.  See doc/hiveminder.txt for more information.",
