  "description": "New: 19 May 2008: See also http://theclapp.org/blog/posts/intro_to_lw-vim-mode/ about a partial vi-mode for Lispworks.\n\nNew: 1 May 2008: Interested users should check out LIMP at http://mikael.jansson.be/hacking/limp/docs/ and/or vimscript#2219.  Among other improvements, it replaces funnel.pl with screen, which I've thought would be a good idea for a while now but never got around to implementing.\n\n---\n\nVIlisp.vim defines functions and key mappings to send Lisp code to a CMU Common Lisp process running in a separate terminal window.  VIlisp basically automates cut-and-paste from Vim to Lisp.  Vim writes to a FIFO created by a Perl script, funnel.pl.  Funnel takes input from Vim and the keyboard and sends it to Lisp.\n\nI use: Vim v6.3.71, CMU CL 19a-release-20040728 + minimal debian patches, and Perl 5.8.4.  funnel.pl requires the GNU Readline library (4.2 or higher), and Perl modules IO::Pty, Term::ReadLine, and Term::ReadLine::Gnu.  Developed on Debian \"sarge\" GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.6.  YMMV.\n\nfunnel.pl would probably work with any Lisp that will run in an xterm; just change how it exits Lisp; CMU CL uses \"(ext:quit)\".  With other minor alterations, it'd probably work with other scrolled-from-the-bottom interpreters (e.g. I've received reports of it working with Octave and R).\n\nInterested users should also see vimscript #165.  I haven't tried it, but from the description, it looks like it might fit the bill.\n\nAs of June 2002:\n\nVIlisp.vim also interfaces to your local copy of the Common Lisp HyperSpec (e.g. lookup \"defun\"), and does Lisp keyword lookups via an included Vim thesaurus file (e.g. expand \"with-\" into with-accessors, then with-compilation-unit, then with-condition-restarts, etc).\n\nSee the README for documentation.",

Put it in the same directory as VIlisp.vim, and VIlisp.vim will find it.\n\nIn an Xterm, run\n\n    export PERL_RL=gnu                  # use GNU readline in funnel\n    perl funnel.pl $HOME/.lisp-pipe lisp\n\nIn a different xterm, run e.g.\n\n    vim test.lisp\n\nSee the README for more extensive configuration information, and for how to configure VIlisp to use your browser to access your local copy of the Common Lisp HyperSpec.",
