  "description": "Ment for cpp class member functions, also works for normal c functions; modify for others...\nThis is not perfect, but works pretty good. -- Works out of the box, however you may want to customize it some. Customization is as easy as defining some global vars...\n\n\" OPTIOINAL: Place something like the below in your .vimrc or where ever you like to keep your global option vars and change as desired.\n\" Note, these are the defaults.\n\"*****************************************************************\n\" GHPH Options: {{{\n\"*****************************************************************\n\" See copycppdectoimp.vim for more documtation.\n\" Virtual: 1 for commented, else removed.\nlet g:ghph_ShowVirtual                    = 0\n\" Static:  1 for commented, else removed.\nlet g:ghph_ShowStatic                     = 0\n\" Default Params: 3 for /*5*/, 2 for /* = 5*/, else removed.\nlet g:ghph_ShowDefaultParams     = 3\n\" Command: 1 to define :GHPH (default if nothing defined), 0 to NOT define.\nlet g:ghph_useGHPH                       = 1\n\" Command: 1 to define :GH and :PH, 0 to NOT define.\n\"let g:ghph_useGHandPH               = 1\n\" }}}\n\n\n:GHPH when in a header file (.h) and on a member function decloration.\nThen :GHPH when in a source file (.cpp or the like) where you want the properly expanded implimentation of the member function.\n(There is also :GH and :PH or :GHPH g :GHPH p as alternitive methods of using this, see below.)\n\nPlease see the comments in the file for more info.\n\nExample:\nclass CTest\n{\n    void Test_Member_Function_G(\n        int        _iSomeNumber,                //!< doxy comment\n        char    * _cpSomeString,            //!< Same\n        float    /*_fNotused*/,        //!< not used param. Heh aka error stress test.\n        int        _iFlags = 0            /*!< I think */\n        );    // yea whatever.\n}\n// nested classes/structs and inlined functions supported.\n// If you have something you want to work but doesnt email me an I'll see if I can get it to.\n\nPlace cursor on line with 'Test_Member_Function_G' and :GHPH\nPlace cursor in .cpp file where you want function and :GHPH gives you:\nvoid CTest::Test_Member_Function_G(int _iSomeNumber, char * _cpSomeString, float /*_fNotused*/, int _iFlags/*0*/)\n{\n}\nWith your cursor on the opening brace ready for a o\n\nHow static, virtual and default params are comented in the function are configurable (can totally remove them if you like), See the file for more info.\n\nNote that you call :GHPH twice (I was playing with this idea--one less thing to remember) The function decides what to do based on the file extension (only .h at the moment but easy to change/add more). If you like it is as easy as unreming the command definitions to get :GH and :PH.\n\nYou can overide :GHPH's attempt to be clever and force getting the definition or putting the implimentation via :GHPH g and :GHPH p respectivly.\n\nAlthough still a work in progress it both functions and behaves well.\n\n\nTo TRY this all you need to is place this in your ftplugin/cpp directory and then :GHPH on a member function and :GHPH in the source file. Don't like it? remove the file from ftplugin/cpp\n\n\nThanks to Leif Wickland for VIM-Tip#335 from which this file derived.\nSee: http://vim.sourceforge.net/tip_view.php?tip_id=335\n\nWhat YOU would like to see in this script wanted, drop me an email.\nHappy VIMing!",
