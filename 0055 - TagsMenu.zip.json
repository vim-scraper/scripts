  "description": "*TagsMenu.txt*   Plugin to add all known tags to a menu.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe following is a cut-and-paste of the TagsMenu help file that is packaged in the attached zip file.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPURPOSE                                             *TagsMenu-purpose*\n\nThis plugin will find all the tags in the current file, and make a menu of these tags.  Each menu item is a move command to that tag (not actually a :tag command, but a /unique search pattern/ to that tag).\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS                                        *TagsMenu-requirements*\n\nThe only requirement for this plugin to work is that Exuberant Ctags (see |ctags|) version 5.x is installed somewhere in your path.  If you do have it installed but not in your path, you could also set the |TagsMenu_ctagsCommand| to explicitly point to your ctags installation.  No other external requirements are necessary.\n\n\nINSTALLATION                                        *TagsMenu-installation*\n\nTo add the plugin, see the vim help on the subject |add-global-plugin| (:h add-global-plugin).  To add the accompanying help file, see the vim help on the subject |add-local-help|.\n\n\nEXECUTION                                           *TagsMenu-execution*\n\nAutomatic execution:  the plugin will automaticly execute (depending on the value of the |TagsMenu_useAutoCommand| option) when a buffer is entered of a recognized filetype (see |TagsMenu-filetypes|).\n\nManual execution:  there are two ways to manually force the recalculation of the menu: \n    <leader>t\n        - this mapping depends on the value of <leader> for your configuration.  By default it is '&#039.  See |mapleader|.\n    menu Tags -> Rebuild Tags Menu \n        - this will only appear if the tags menu has already been created.\n\n\nREGOGNIZED FILETYPES                                *TagsMenu-filetypes*\n\nThe current list of recognized |filetypes| is limited to the list of types recognized by ctags.  These include: asm, awk, c, cpp, cxx, sh, cobol, eiffel, fortran, java, lisp, make, pascal, perl, php, python, rexx, ruby, scheme, tcl, and vim.\n\n\n\nVersion: 0.93\nAuthor: Jay Dickon Glanville (plus others) <jayglanville at rogers.com>\nLocation: http://members.rogers.com/jayglanville/tagsmenu\nLast Modified: 4 Dec 2001\n",
