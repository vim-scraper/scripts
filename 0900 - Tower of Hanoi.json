Best played in GUI version of Vim.\n\n- Comes with two modes, a demo mode and a play mode. \n- You can start the game by using the command :Hanoi optionally passing the number of disks as an argument. \n- If no argument is passed, you are prompted to enter a value. \n- The maximum number of disks is determined based on the size of your vim window.\n- You will be prompted to choose between demo or play mode.\n- In demo mode, the script plays for you, just sit and relax.\n- In play mode, you can use h, j, k, l keys to move the disks from pole to pole. The disk with dashes represents the current disk that you can move.\n- Keys h and k select the current pole, and thus the top most disk on the pole.\n- Keys k and j move the disk up and down.\n- In play mode, you can pause the game by pressing <Space>, and come back by using :Hanoi command again.\n- You can stop the game at any time by pressing <C-C> or <C-Break>\n\nGood exerciese to practice hjkl key movements, if you are new to Vi realm :)\n\n\n\nSearch_key_words: tower hanoi game games hari krishna dara",
