I only hope to aide those who have found themselves in the position of working with it as I have :-)\n\nPointers were taken from many syntax files, mainly the basic.vim syntax file from Allan Kelly. <allan@fruitloaf.co.uk>\n\nUpdate: I no longer work with ProvideX!  Congratulations are welcome :-)",
