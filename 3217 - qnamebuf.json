  "description": "I really like qname (vimscript #2317) and qbuf (vimscript #1910) and decided that it would be nice to combine them.  The author recommended I upload under my name.\n\nUsage:\n<F4> opens a list of the current buffers, and typing a string filters the list (by default ala lustyexplorer vimscript #1890).  All filtering is case insensitive (even if using Regular Expressions).  If there are many files open goes to a simplified view (just relative buffer number, and the filename with path), when filtered enough shows more information:\n    1) Relative Buffer Number\n    2) Current Buffer (%), Alternative Buffer (#), or if it is open in a visible split (=)\n    3) File name\n    4) Buffer number\n    5) Relative file path\n\nWhen Open:\n    <BS> Delete last char entered\n    <C-U> Delete all entered chars\n    <M-L> Toggle between listed and unlisted buffers\n    <M-D> bdelete the selected buffer, the explorer stays open and retains cursor position\n    <M-C> Close the window containing the buffer\n    <ESC> or <F4> close the explorer\n    <CR> Open the selected file in the current window\n    <M-S> Open the selected file in a split window\n    <M-V> Open the selected file in a vert split window\n    <M-T> Open the selected file in a new tab\n    <UP> <DOWN> <LEFT> <RIGHT> navigates the selection\n    <HOME> <END> move to the first/last item\n    <M-1>, ..., <M-0> open the first, ..., tenth file in the list\n\nNote, I wanted these to be <C-...> but <C-1>...<C-0> are not real key sequences.\n\nCustomization:\n    g:qnamebuf_hotkey  Set the default key to toggle qnamebuf (defaults to <F4>)\n    nmap <KEY> :call QNameBufInit(1)<cr>:~ Use regular expressions instead of the lusty file filter\n    nmap <KEY> :call QNameBufInit(X, <SIZE>)<cr>:~ Set the popup size to SIZE, defaults to 1/2 the visible lines (&lines / 2)\n\nHints:\nI find the following mappings very useful (jump to the ith file):\n    nmap <silent> <M-1> :brewind<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-2> :brewind \\| 1bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-3> :brewind \\| 2bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-4> :brewind \\| 3bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-5> :brewind \\| 4bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-6> :brewind \\| 5bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-7> :brewind \\| 6bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-8> :brewind \\| 7bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-9> :brewind \\| 8bn<CR>\n    nmap <silent> <M-0> :brewind \\| 9bn<CR>\nWhen starting the buffer the numbers are displayed and this allows consistant access.",
