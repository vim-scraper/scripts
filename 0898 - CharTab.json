  "description": "This script provides a character table. Yes, yet another one :-). \n\nBut it has some nice features:                                      \n  - it takes advantage of syntax-highlighting\n  - it allows to toggle base of codes without leaving buffer\n  - it opens in currently active window, so no rearrangement of windows occur\n  - special codes are viewed with their real names (NUL, ETX,...)\n  - quitting is very simple and fast - just one keystroke\n",
