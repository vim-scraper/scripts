  "description": "These two scripts provide syntax highlighting and automatic code indentation for BlitzBasic code. Supported are the Blitz2D and Blitz3D commandsets.\n\nPlease note that there's one little bug: I couldn't determine which regular expression to use for if statements to indent correctly. Therefore you always have to write a 'Then' at the end of an if statement - which looks better anyway, in my opinion. ;-) Whatever, if you know how to change the regex to support both versions (with and without 'Then'), feel free to contact me.",
