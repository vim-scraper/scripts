  "description": "These are the color theme designed by mrkn based on \"desert256\" theme created by Henry So, Jr.  This theme is designed to work with with 88- and 256-color xterms.\n\nA screen shot is available at http://img.skitch.com/20100215-rxeg4nguregi8i21dyarspmsgc.png\n\nThe ancestor version \"desert256\" theme is available at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1243\n\nThe real feature of this color scheme, with a wink to the \"inkpot\" theme, is the programmatic approximation of the gui colors to the palettes of 88- and 256- color xterms.  The functions that do this (folded away, for readability) are calibrated to the colors used for Thomas E. Dickey's xterm (version 200), which is available at http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html.\n\nHenry had struggled with trying to parse the rgb.txt file to avoid the necessity of converting color names to #rrggbb form, but decided it was just not worth the effort.  I thank a lot for his results.\n",
