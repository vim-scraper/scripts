Since (sigh) ABNF seems to be whitespace sensitive, that could be a problem.\n\nAdded support for marking comments which are not part of a rule (i.e. at the beginning of a file).\n\nBoth of these new features may be enabled or disabled according to your preference.\n\nThe whitespace matching is enabled by default, but may be disabled via {{{let abnf_ignore_whitespace=1}}}.\n\nThe comments thing is disabled by default and may be enabled via {{{let abnf_strict=1}}}"
