I'm not write same file for MetaFont only because I not use this powerfull program, but it is very similar to MetaPost language and if somebody ask me to write it I may be do this.\n\nSo this is citation from mp.vim where I wrote about indent in MetaPost\n\n\" Identation Rules: {{{1 \n\" First of all, MetaPost language don't expect any identation rules.\n\" This screept need for you only if you (not MetaPost) need to do\n\" exactly code. If you don't need to use indentation, see\n\" :help filetype-indent-off\n\"\n\" Note: Every rules of identation in MetaPost or TeX languages (and in some\n\" other of course) is very subjective. I can release only my vision of this\n\" promlem.\n\"\n\" ..........................................................................\n\" Example of correct (by me) identation {{{2\n\" shiftwidth=4\n\" ==========================================================================\n\" for i=0 upto 99:\n\"     z[i] = (0,1u) rotated (i*360/100);\n\" endfor\n\" draw z0 -- z10 -- z20\n\"         withpen ...     % <- 2sw because breaked line\n\"         withcolor ...;  % <- same as previous\n\" draw z0 for i=1 upto 99:\n\"             -- z[i]             % <- 1sw from left end of 'for' satement\n\"         endfor withpen ...      % <- 0sw from left end of 'for' satement\n\"                 withcolor ...;  % <- 2sw because breaked line\n\" draw if One:     % <- This is internal if (like 'for' above)\n\"          one\n\"      elsif Other:\n\"          other\n\"      fi withpen ...;\n\" if one:          % <- This is external if\n\"     draw one;\n\" elseif other:\n\"     draw other;\n\" fi\n\" draw z0; draw z1;\n\" }}}\n\" }}}\n",
