  "script_type": "indent",
  "description": "This is a function meant to deal with a simple case of indentation:\nThe assumption is that you have blocks whose begining and end can be identified by a pattern. In this case, you just set b:indent_block_start and b:indent_block_end to these patterns, and the function returns the indent of a line based on the assumption that all lines within a block should be indented by one shiftwidth. It is also possible to ignore lines matching a certain pattern (e.g., comments) using a third variable b:indent_ignore. For an example, see the fluxbox indent file (vimscript #679).",
  "install_details": "Put this in the plugin subdir of your favorite part in the runtimepath (e.g., ~/.vim/plugin). Alternatively, put it somewhere else and source it from an indent file where you'd like to use it.",
