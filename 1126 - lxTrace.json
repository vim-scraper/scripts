My line looks like\n  \t\tthis:\n\t\t\tlet g:winManagerWindowLayout = 'FileExplorer,TagList|BufExplorer,LxTrace'\n  \t\t\n  TIPS:\n  \t\tDocumentation (when written..:o) is found at the bottom of this file. \n  \t\tThanks to code from vimspell.vim it should be self-installing the first\n  \t\ttime this module is loaded. When installed you could try \n  \t\t\t:help lxTrace\n \n  NOTE:\n\t\t10 Nov 2004 (v 0.1) This is my initial upload. The module probably \n\t\tmisses functionality and has undetected bugs. So feel free to\n\t\tsuggest improvements.\n\t\t\n\n  Best Regards\n  Staale Flock, (staale -- lexholm .. no)\n  Norway\n",
