  "summary": "A fast and extensible buffer explorer.",
  "script_type": "utility",
  "description": "PLEASE READ THE INSTALL SECTION COMPLETELY.\n\nSelectBuf is a buffer explorer similar to the file explorer plugin that comes\nwith Vim, the difference being that file explorer allows you to view the files\non the file system, where as buffer explorer limits the view to only the files\nthat are already opened in the current Vim session. It is even possible and \neasy to extend the plugin with new commands.\n\nSince the first time I released it in Jul '99 (try sending an email to \nvim-thread.1235@vim.org), the script has gone many\nrevisions and enhancements both in technology and features, taking advantage of all the niceties that the new versions of Vim has to offer.\n\nFor detailed help, see \":help selectbuf\" or read doc/selectbuf.txt. \n\n- Install the plugin, restart vim and press <F3> (the default key binding) to\n  get the list of buffers.\n- Move the cursor on to the buffer that you need to select and press <CR> or\n  double click with the left-mouse button.\n- If you want to close the window without making a selection, press <F3>\n  again.\n- You can also press ^W<CR> or O to open the file in a new or previous window.\n  You can use d to delete or D to wipeout the buffer. Use d again to\n  undelete a previously deleted buffer (you need to first view the deleted\n  buffers using u command).\n\nYou can change the default key mapping to open browser window by setting \n\n      nmap <unique> <silent> <YourKey> <Plug>SelectBuf\n\nAlmost everything is configurable, including all the key mappings that are\navailable. E.g., you can change the help key to <C-H> instead of the default ?,\nso you can free it to do backward searches in the file list, using the\nfollowing mapping:\n\n      noremap <silent> <Plug>SelBufHelpKey <C-H> \n\nSome highlights of the features are:\n\n- It is super fast as the buffer list is cached and incrementally built as new\n  files are added and the old ones are deleted.\n- Hide buffer numbers to save on real estate (goes well with \"Always On\" mode\n  or when used with WinManager).\n- Opens a new window to avoid disturbing your existing windows. But you can\n  change the behavior to reuse the current window or even to permanently keep\n  it open.\n- You can select block of buffers and delete or wipeout all the buffers at once.\n- You can toggle various settings on and off while you are in the browser. You\n  can e.g., toggle showing the buffer indicators by pressing i.\n- Goes very well with WinManager.\n- There are different sorting keys available. You can sort by buffer number,\n  name, type (extension), path, indicators and MRU order. You can even select a\n  default sort order\n- If you use multiple windows, then the browser restores the window sizes after\n  closing it.\n- Syntax coloring makes it easy to find the buffer you are looking to switch to.\n- Full configurability.\n- Extensibility.\n- Support for WinManager and multiselect plugins.\n- and many more.\n\nFor more information, read the vim help on seletbuf.\n\n\nSearch_key_words: buffer selectbuf bufexplorer explorer list select multvals genutils multiselect Hari Krishna Dara\n",

You can even sort the\n  contents and still not loose your selections.\n- |:SBSettings| is now more flexible and easier to use as it supports arguments\n  and command-line completion.\n- The global variables for the settings are no longer removed, but you should\n  still run |:SBInitialize| for any side effects to take place.

The browser caches the\n      the list of buffers and incrementally changes it as you open new\n      files and delete them.\n    - Hide buffer numbers to save real estate (useful with \"Always on\"\n      mode or with WinManager).\n    - New vim help file with detailed description of features and configuration.\n    - Block operations for buffer deletes now works well.\n    - \"Always On\" mode is now much better.\n    - Marks for a quick access to the next, previous and current buffers\n      has a better meaning.\n    - WinManager integration.

So the script is now mostly clean and very stable.\n\n- Now sort by name and sort by path are separate.\n- Fixed the bug in remembering the cursor position.\n- More configurability of the script. Fix for avoiding the global config params from cluttering the global namespace.\n- You can specify a default sort order.\n- Syntax coloring in the browser window is much better now.\n- Added P command to show/hide paths.\n- Improved stability.\n\nIt is very close to a release version now."

You can now sort by \"buffer number\", \"name\", \"type\" or by \"indicators\".\n  - Use s to select the sort type forward.\n  - Use S to select the sort type backward.\n  - Use r to sort in the reverse order.\n  - Since r is more appropriate (and familiar) for reverse sorting, I used R to refresh the browser.\n- I got the solution for the toggling the meaning of activation key, so now you can use the same key that activates the browser to even close it. So provided you have <F3> mapped, you can have a quick look at the browser by pressing <F3> twice in quick succession.\n- I also used some nice 6.0 features to make the browser buffer more friendly.\n- Fixed the spurious nomodifiable problem (happens occassionally). Thanks for reporting this problem.\n"
