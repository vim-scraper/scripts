  "description": "foldcol.vim is a plugin which implements two maps:\n\nctrl-v move \\fc  : select a visual block, then \\fc will fold the region away\n\n\\fc : when not in visual-block mode (ie. in normal mode), a \\fc will undo the visual-block folds produced by foldcol.vim.\n\n(alpha/beta version available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#FOLDCOL)\n",
  "install_details": "Put the script into your .vim/plugin (Windows: vimfiles\\plugin) directory.\n\nYou'll also need Vince Negri's conceal-ownsyntax patch, which is available at vimscript#302, to apply the patch, and to re-compile vim.  It is hoped that vim 7.0 will already incorporate the conceal-ownsyntax patch, although that hasn't happened yet.\n",
