  "description": "DESCRIPTION\nThis plugin indicates the state of the buffer (modified, readonly,\nunmodifiable, special non-file \"scratch\") / window (is preview window) by\nchanging the highlighting of the window's status line. It defines additional\nStatusLine... / StatusLine...NC highlight groups that are customizable and by\ndefault use different colors to differentiate the buffer states. \n\nAn example screenshot can be found at\n    http://ingo-karkat.de/swdev/vim/StatusLineHighlight.png\n\nHOW IT WORKS\nUsing different colors for the status line is trickier than it seems: Though\nthe 'statusline' setting supports inline expressions via %{expr}, the returned\ntext is taken as-is; highlight items %#hlgroup# and #* are not evaluated, only\nprinted as text. Evaluation does happen when one %!expr is used, but the\nexpression seems to be evaluated only once for a complete screen redraw cycle,\nnot for each individual status line, so one cannot use it to set different\nhighlightings for different status lines. \n\nTherefore, this plugin sets up autocmds that continually adapt buffer-local\n'statusline' settings (which prepend the highlight group to the (mostly)\nglobal setting (though local 'statusline' settings set by ftplugins are kept,\ntoo)). \n\nUSAGE\nThis plugin does not introduce any commands or mappings. Just observe the\nchanged status line colors, e.g. when using :view, :pedit, :help, etc. \n\nYou immediately see that a buffer is read-only because its status line is\ngray, not black; unmodifiable buffers are even \"more\" gray. Unsaved, modified\nbuffers are indicated via a dark-red status line. Special windows like the\ncommand and quickfix windows, as well as many \"scratch\" buffers used by\nplugins are shown in dark blue. The preview window is now also easy to find,\nbecause it has a blue status line. ",
