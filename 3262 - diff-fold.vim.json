  "description": "View patches or pipe various Mercurial diff output to vim and see changesets, files, and hunks folded nicely together.\n\nSome examples:\n       hg in --patch | vim - -c \"setlocal ft=diff\"\n       hg diff | gvim -\n       hg diff -r 12 -r 13 | vim -\n\nRight now, this pretty much just works with Mercurial diff output.  Because Hg can use Git style patches, it does work with some Git output but it is not 100% reliable or useful.\n\nEventually, I hope to make this work with more version control systems and just about anything that can produce unified diff output.\n\nThe script can also be found on my bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/thetoast/vimstuff",
