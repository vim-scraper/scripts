  "description": "This script defines a new command 'GotoFile', which resembles the normal\n'gf' function, but uses a standard tags file generated by ctags for\nlooking up the file name under the cursor. \n\nYou need to generate a standard tags file (with ctags) for this script to work.\nAdd the following ctags option for generating filename tags: --extra=+f\n\nFor example: ctags -R --extra=+f\n\nAdd the following mapping to your .vimrc (or _vimrc) to replace the\nnormal 'gf' behavior by the GotoFile command:\n\nnmap <silent> gf :GotoFile<CR>\n\nI wrote this script mainly for having an alternative for setting the\npath and using 'gf'. While using completion all header files within\nthe path are also searched, which causes a major performance hit for\nlarge projects (at least for me). So this script allows using the\n'gf' feature without setting the path. Other suggestions are welcome!\n",
