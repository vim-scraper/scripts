  "description": "More info at http://eigenclass.org/hiki/simplefold\n\nsimplefold is a small plugin that improves (for some definition of \"improve\", see the explanation and screenshots at http://eigenclass.org/hiki/simplefold) on other folding methods (syntax, marker, indent, expr). It was originally written for Ruby, but now also supports Objective Caml, PHP, Perl and Java. It features:\n* optimized vertical space usage\n* sensible foldtext\n* top-level folds: one per interesting definition. No need to open a class fold to see which methods it contains. Get a quick overview of the classes/methods/functions (whatever applies in the current filetype) with zM.\n* optional nested folds for if/while and so on\n* easy to adapt to other filetypes; just by setting 2-3 regexps\n\nUsage\n---------\nUse <Leader>f (by default \\f) to fold.\n\nYou can also use \n :Fold UNQUOTED-REGEXP\n\nto create folds showing the lines matching the given regexp, leaving everything else hidden; e.g.\n\n :Fold \\vfoo(bar|baz)\n\nwill create folds starting at each line matching foo(bar|baz), so that these are the only lines you see in your buffer (it's effectively a sort of internal grep).\n\nSee also vimtip#77 and vimscript #158",
