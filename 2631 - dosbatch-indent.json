It just follows these rules:\n - generally keep the indent of the previous line \n - if previous line is not a comment and has ( and no matching ), increase indent\n - if this line starts with ), decrease indent\n\nI started by cutting down and modifying Erik Janssen's awk.vim.",
  "install_details": "Copy the file into one of the indent directories in your runtime path (see :help 'runtimepath'), personally I put it in c:\\program files\\vim\\vimfiles\\indent\\\n\nMake sure filetype-specific indenting is switched on (see :help filetype), personally I put this in my _vimrc file\n\n:filetype indent on",
