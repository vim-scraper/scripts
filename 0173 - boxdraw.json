  "description": "Summary\n-------\n * Draw diagrams and tables using \"real box drawing characters\" (AKA ANSI\nart).\n * Move rectangular/linear blocks of text around.\n * Trace box-drawing typeset diagrams -- follow the lines, etc.\n\nDetailed description\n--------------------\nThese scripts facilitate drawing simple 'ANSI' graphic containing box\ndrawing characters (not just '+', '-' and '|', but REAL box drawing\ncharacters).  It can be useful to draw diagrams and fancy tables (at\nleast, I use it this way).\n\nUpon sourcing the script defines several macros:\n\n<shift+arrow> -- moves cursor in specified direction leaving trail of\nbox drawing characters, making all joins and crossings.\ng+<arrow> -- follow line of boxdrawing characters until it reaches\nintersection or ends.\n<shift+arrow> in visual mode -- move selected rectangular block in\nspecified direction.\n\\e -- ends box drawing mode (unmap shift+arrows macros and restore\nvirtualedit value)\n\\b -- restarts box drawing (map shift+arrows macros and set virtual\n      edit=all)\n\\s -- selects 'single-line' boxdrawing characters\n\\d -- selects 'double-line' boxdrawing characters\n\\a -- convert all characters in selection into ascii '+', '-', '|' (utf8\n      only, not implemented)\n(\"\\\" prefix may be changed by changing mapleader variable, see :h mapleader)\n\nWhen rectangular block is selected, it can be moved around using\n<shift-arrow> keys. Unfortunately, as of version 6.1 multibyte\ncharacters and rectangular blocks do not live together too good, so this\nfeature is experimental.\n\nWhen line block is selected, <shift-up> and <shift-down> moves it up or down\nnondestructively, <shift-left> decreases indent and <shift-up> increases\nindent.\n\nCurrently box drawing is supported for utf8 and cp437 (DOS) encodings.\n\nScript does not use any \"weird\" box drawing characters from unicode set\nthat are not present in, say, cp437. So, it is safe to save utf-8 file\nin any single byte encoding that contains regular single box drawing\ncharacters.\nThis script also contains mapping that converts all boxdrawing\ncharacters in current selection into ascii '+', '-', '|'.\n\nIf vim encoding is single byte, this script assumes cp437 (DOS). Most\nencodings have boxdrawing characters at the same place, however, some\n(notably, koi8-r) have them in different code postions.\nIf you want to use it with encoding that contains such\ncharacters in diferent place, please drop me a note -- I will be happy\nto add support for that codepage too.\n\nTo help you determine which boxdrawing characters are suppored by your\nterminal I have included file sampler.txt. Just type it (or cat it) on\nthe termianal and encoding that labels the block that looks \"right\" will\nbe your supported encoding.\n\nNote for PuTTY users\n--------------------\n\nIt turns out that PuTTY does not translate Shift+Arrow combination into\nX key code (like xterm does), so mappings will not work for this\nterminal. I have modified initialization script to use <arrows> instead\nof <shift>+<arrows> in Unix environment.\n\nPerl scripts\n------------\n\nSome box-drawing related procedures are more naturally done with\nexternal scripts. These scripts take ascii standard input and produce\nutf8 encoded standard output.\n\nbdua2b.pl -- converts regular '+-|'-style drawing into single-line utf8\n  boxdrawing. This script has does not just blindly replace characters,\n  but instead looks to the neighbourhood and chooses boxdrawing\n  character that fits best. Use this script as a filter to convert\n  existing ascii drawings.\n  Option -ss selects single border characters, -sd -- double border,\n  -sh -- single vertical double horizontal, -sv single horizontal double\n  vertical.\n\noutline.pl -- outlines groups of similar characters in the input with\n  boxdrawing characters. Option -d makes output twice as wide, options\n  -s* select boxdrawing flavor as in previous script.\n  For example,\n\n  aaaacc\n  abbcc\n  ccbbc\n  cccb\n\nwill be converted into\n\n  ┌───┬─┐\n  │┌─┬┘┌┘\n  ├┴┐└┐│\n  │ └┐├┘\n  └──┴┘\n\nor\n\n  ┌───────┬───┐\n  │ ┌───┬─┘ ┌─┘\n  ├─┴─┐ └─┐ │\n  │   └─┐ ├─┘\n  └─────┴─┘\n\n\nBoth scripts were tested with ActivePerl 5.6.1.\n\nPlans:\n------\n* Support double boxes in a cleaner way.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nCopy boxdraw.vim to the place where you normally keep vim scripts (e.g. ~/.vim\nor c:\\vim\\vimfiles) and source it every time you want to draw a diagram or nice\ntable.\n\nYou may wish also to add this to your menu by adding a line to your .gvimrc\n(_gvimrc) file (use actual path to boxdraw.vim):\n:menu Tools.Bo&x\\ Draw :so ~/.vim/boxdraw.vim<CR>\n\nEnvironment\n-----------\nI run Windows and use boxdraw.vim in gvim (it supports utf-8 very\nnicely) and bd-single in vim (its support of utf-8 is kind of unclear\nfor me). Both major Windows monospaced fonts (Courier New and Lucida\nConsole) support wide range of Unicode characters, including box\ndrawing.\n\nWhy use box drawing characters?\n-------------------------------\nThese characters are in Unicode standard for compatibility with wide\nrange of existing 8-bit encodings that have them. The wording of Unicode\nstandard discourages usage of such characters, other than for the\npurpose of converting between encodigns and storage of legacy data.\nHaving said all that I found that sometimes a picture, even crude and\nprimitive, is worth pages of explanations. Just about the only way to\ninclude picture in source code is to use ascii or \"ansi\" art. Ascii is\nmore compatible, but \"ansi\" looks way better. Since I have to use\nUnicode to include cyrillic characters in comments anyway, I decided to\nstop on \"ansi\" art as a format of choice for in-source drawings.\n\nAuthor\n------\nAndrew Nikitin <nsg21@hotmail.com>\n",
