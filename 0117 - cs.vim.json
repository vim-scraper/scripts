Some things don't work correctly, or aren't done yet (#region folding, stuff like that), but it's fairly generic enough to have a nice base for adding things.\n\nTo add:\n- error classes\n- directionals (and call them that)\n- operators\n- #region folding\n\nI'll copy the contents of the System classes and integrate coloring for that (probably by copying wholesale from vimscript #116) if someone really wants me to do so. Ain't Open Source great? =P",
