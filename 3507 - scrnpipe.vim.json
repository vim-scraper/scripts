  "description": "This plugin allows you to send a range of lines from a buffer to another screen window. This could be used for all sorts of things but my motivation was to be able to edit SQL statements in a file and then send them to a open mysql client session in another window. You could also send ruby code to a running erb or bash commands to a bash prompt, etc. You could even use this as a quick way to paste between 2 vim sessions running in different windows (or even different screen sessions).\n\nThe plugin creates some mapping by default. \n\nIn normal mode || sends the current line to another screen window. In visual modes use |.\n\nIf you have a mapleader set you'll need to type that first for both mapings. See :help mapleader for more info on that.\n\nYou can create you own mappings to override these. For the normal mode do this:\n\nnmap <whatever> <Plug>ScreenPipeSend\n\nFor visual modes do this:\n\nvmap <whatever> <Plug>ScreenPipeOpSend\n\nJust replace <whatever> with what you want to map of course.\n\nFinally, this plugin also provides a :ScreenPipe command to do the same thing.\n\nThe code is available on git here:\n\nhttps://github.com/bundacia/ScreenPipe\n\nKNOWN BUGS:\n1. The window list doesn't show up on the mac (but choosing the right number still works)\n\nTODO:\n1. Implement an operator.",
