  "description": "This is yet another script to do some code commenting/uncommenting. It is simple and easy to use, and should work for almost any filetype.\n\nIt defines a command :CommentStyle which takes one argument, which can be either a comment prefix (\"# \" for shell) or a comment string (\"/* @ */\" for C) with a @ as a placeholder.\nIt also defines three mappings: >c to comment, <c to uncomment, and =c to change the CommentStyle.\n\nNested comments are handled correctly (this means that if you comment the following C code line:\nx /* comment */ ++;\nthen the inner comment will be protected).",
