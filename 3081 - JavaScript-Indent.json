And due to javascripts lax syntactical structure cindent() just wont cut it. \n\nWeb-Indent handles all basic forms of add notes, bugs and multi-line and singe line objects: \nvar x = {\n     y : {\n           z;\n     }\n}\n\nvar y = [\n      x,\n      y,\n      z\n]\n\nvar z = {x : x, y : y, w: w};\n\nt; // no indent\n\nHandles all basic control structures (with or without leading '{'):\nif(x)\n      // comment\n      y;\nz;\n\nHandles inline and nextline control structure block initializers ('{' in the vernacular):\nif(x) {\n     x;\n} \nelse \n{\n     z; \n}\n\nHandles multi-line function declarations:\nvar x = function( \n      y, // notice one tab over\n      z,\n      w) {\n      t;\n}\n\nHandles multi-line control structure statements:\nif( x == y ||\n      y == z ||\n      z == w) \n{\n      t;\n}\n\nThis indenter is also fully compatible with Mootools and esp. its Class package.  I haven't tested it with any of the other frameworks, but due to their similar syntactical nature, I'm assuming they will work as will.\n\nIncluded Files:\n================================================================================\n      ~test.js - A sample js file with various coding patterns.  Set tabstop=6 and shiftwidth=6 and comments should line up correctly.\n      ~indent/javascript.vim - The core indenting file\n      ~indent/html.vim - An updated version of the pre-packaged html indenter that utilizes javascript.vim (MUST BE LOCATED IN SAME DIRECTORY!!)\n\nRelease Notes:\n================================================================================\n~Beta 3.0 Released: (5/14/10)\n      - Fixed: Runaway Indentation.  \n      - Fixed: indentkeys now correctly invoke indent.\n      - Fixed: Comment lines with keywords are correctly indented.  Thanks to trojhlav for pointing it out.\n      - Notes:\n            \\ First Release Candidate (v 1.0)\n            \\ Correctly indented entire jQuery source.\n            \\ Correctly indented entire MooTools source.\n      - Concerns: \n            \\ Still no support for continuation lines.\n~ \n\n\n~Beta 2.2 Released: (5/6/10)\n      - Added: Support for enabling/disabling logging.  (Enabled by default.  To Disable: let g:js_indent_log = 0 somewhere in your .vimrc script)\n      - Added: Support for while() control block. \n      - Added: Support for do {} while(); control block. \n      - Added: Support for with() {} control block. \n      - Added: Skeleton support for all MULTI-LINE cntrl blocks  SINGLE LINE cntrl blocks DO NOT HAVE SKELETON VERSIONS!! \n      - Added: Skeleton support for function declarations. \n      - Added: Skeleton support for basic objects. \n      - Added: Tests for skeleton code.\n      - Fixed: Html indent now correctly calls GetJsIndent() while inside <script type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n      - Fixed: Html will now source the javascript.vim (indent file) via two methods:\n            1.  If g:js_indent is set and points to the location of the indent file, it will source it.\n            2. Looks in your runtime path for indent/javascript.vim (sources first one found)\n      - Added: Tests for HTML + JS\n      - Notes:\n            \\ None\n~ \n\n~Beta 2.1 Released: (5/6/10)\n      - Fixed: Object ending regex is now anchored to beginning and end of line and cannot contain preceding {'s or ['s.\n      - Fixed: Multi Line Invocations.  \n      - Dependencies:\n            \\ Syntax Script must return *Comment* for any type of comment when invoked with synIDattr\n      - Concerns:\n            \\ Multi Line Invocations must end in ; or , to be recognized (although JS doesn't specifically require this) (so as not confuse with multi line declarations)\n            \\ Does not recognize continuation lines. \n      - Notes:\n            \\ Entire test.js file is now correctly indented (except for continuations)\n            \\ NOW SUPPORTS SKELETON CODE\n                  if(x) {\n                  } else if(y) {\n                  } else {\n                  }\n~\n\n~Beta 2.0 Released: (5/5/10)\n      - Now hosted on Google Code: http://code.google.com/p/web-indent/\n      - Completely rewrote script\n      - Fixed: Comments are determined by synIDAttr instead of Regex\n      - Added: Anonymous function support. (function(){})();\n      - Dependencies:\n            \\ None\n      - Concerns:\n            \\ Too many if statements, but extremely well organized.\n            \\ Sometimes vim has trouble indenting an entire file.  Have to scroll through to location above problem area and use =G again. Is this a problem with how the scripts get loaded?\n      - Notes\n            \\ None\n~\n\n~ Beta 1.0 Released: (5/3/10)\n      - Initial Release\n      - Dependencies:\n            \\ Javascript Syntax: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1491\n      - Concerns:\n            \\ Comments are determined by regex (==> Cannot determine middle of block comments)\n            \\ Code is poorly organized and hard to understand.\n~\n\nPS: I'm also not sure if I'm allowed to repost the html.vim, since I couldn't find a license for it.  I'm pretty sure it was the one packaged with vim by default.  If anyone has any objections, I'll take it down immediately.",
  "install_details": "Installation With Pathogen:\n      1. Place in pathogen directory\n\nInstallation W/Out Pathogen:\n      1. Place in .vim/indent directory, or anywhere in your runtime path.\n      2. If placed outside of .vim/indent directory, set g:js_indent = /location/to/javascript.vim in your .vimrc file. (This tells the html.vim file where to find the javascript indent file)\n\nTo Disable Logging: \n      1.  let g:js_indent_log = 0 in your .vimrc file.\n        ",
