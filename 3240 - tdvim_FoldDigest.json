The buffer is called ==FOLDDIGEST==.  It shows\n   not only all fold start positions, but also a tree depended on original\n   folds hierarchy.\n\n   In a FOLDDIGEST, you can move around the cursor, and when type <CR> jump\n   to fold at under it.  If you enter FOLDDIGEST window from other windows,\n   when depended buffer is availabeled, it will be synchronized\n   automatically.  If you want to force synchronize, type \"r\" in a\n   FOLDDIGEST buffer.\n   It is also possible to jump to the folsd under the cursor with a double\n   click.\n   The FOLDDIGEST window is updated when entering in a new buffer.\n\n   :FoldDigestToggle\n\n   Toggles FOLDDIGEST window\n\n   :FoldDigestClose\n\n   close FOLDDIGEST window\n\n   You can also map your own keys to these commands",
