  "description": "I wanted to use vim from the Xilinx ide, and I like the following actions to occur from the IDE\n\n\n1) open every file in a split window in one gvim session\n2) when opening the same file again from the IDE, don't cause a new split window if there is already one\n3) use the line numbers provided by the ide.\n\nIn Xilinx you would define the external editor call \n\n/path/to/vimremote.sh XILINX $1 $2\n\nThe XILINX is just a name so that one particular gvim session is used for it, and not any others you might have hanging around\n\nYou need a decent shell. Don't know how that works in Windows. This script could be useful in many other ide's that allow calls to external editors",
  "install_details": "Just put the file somewhere on your harddisk, and configure your IDE to use it. The call to vimremote.sh has 3 parameters:\n1) unique name for the gvim to associate with a certain IDE\n2) filename\n3) (optional) line number in the file",
