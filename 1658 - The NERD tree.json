  "description": "Grab the latest dev version from github: https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree. \n\nWhat is this \"NERD tree\"??\n\nCheck out this demo http://www.flickr.com/photos/30496122@N07/2862367534/sizes/o/\n\nThe NERD tree allows you to explore your filesystem and to open files and\ndirectories. It presents the filesystem to you in the form of a tree which you\nmanipulate with the keyboard and/or mouse. It also allows you to perform\nsimple filesystem operations.\n\nThe following features and functionality are provided by the NERD tree:\n    * Files and directories are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure\n    * Different highlighting is provided for the following types of nodes:\n        * files\n        * directories\n        * sym-links\n        * windows .lnk files\n        * read-only files\n        * executable files\n    * Many (customisable) mappings are provided to manipulate the tree:\n        * Mappings to open/close/explore directory nodes\n        * Mappings to open files in new/existing windows/tabs\n        * Mappings to change the current root of the tree\n        * Mappings to navigate around the tree\n        * ...\n    * Directories and files can be bookmarked.\n    * Most NERD tree navigation can also be done with the mouse\n    * Filtering of tree content (can be toggled at runtime)\n        * custom file filters to prevent e.g. vim backup files being displayed\n        * optional displaying of hidden files (. files)\n        * files can be \"turned off\" so that only directories are displayed\n    * A textual filesystem menu is provided which allows you to\n      create/delete/move file and directory nodes as well as copy (for\n      supported OSs)\n    * The position and size of the NERD tree window can be customised\n    * The order in which the nodes in the tree are listed can be customised.\n    * A model of your filesystem is created/maintained as you explore it. This\n      has several advantages:\n        * All filesystem information is cached and is only re-read on demand\n        * If you revisit a part of the tree that you left earlier in your\n          session, the directory nodes will be opened/closed as you left them\n    * The script remembers the cursor position and window position in the NERD\n      tree so you can toggle it off (or just close the tree window) and then\n      reopen it (with NERDTreeToggle) the NERD tree window will appear exactly\n      as you left it\n    * You can have a separate NERD tree for each tab, share trees across tabs,\n      or a mix of both.\n    * By default the script overrides the default file browser (netw), so if\n      you :edit a directory a (slighly modified) NERD tree will appear in the\n      current window\n",

Read :help NERDTreePublicFunctions for details (thanks again to AOYAMA Shotaro for the idea :).\n- added 2 new mappings for file nodes: \"g<tab>\" and \"go\". These are the same as the \"<tab>\" and \"o\" maps except that the cursor stays in the NERDTree.

This increases performance insanely! Esp. if you have .svn dirs.\n\n*added the NERDTreeChDirMode option which tells the script if/when to change vims current working dir. Go :help NERDTreeChDirMode for details.\n\n*fixed a feature where vim's current working directory was getting changed all over the show. Now it is never changed unless instructed to do so. Via mappings or the NERDTreeChDirMode option. Thanks to Terrance Cohen for emailing me about this :)\n\n*random bug fixes"

This option, in conjunction with the e/E/middle-mouse mappings allows you to use the NERDTree like windows explorer.\n\n*Now the H and f mappings work without causing the tree root to be refreshed (so all your nodes dont get closed).\n\n*Fixed bugs."
