  "description": "The colorschemes I've seen on vim.sf.net seem to all have dark\nbackgrounds, but the dark backgrounds really bother my eyes.\nAlso, the default white background of gvim is too bright for me.\nPerhaps I'm alone, but a nice off-white background allows me to\nmerrily spend all day long staring at screen after screen after\nscreen of code, day after day, week after week, year after\nyear...  Editing code, reviewing code, documenting code,\ndebugging code, dreaming code in the nightmare that has become my\nlife... Oh, well -- at least this pleasant little colorscheme helps me\nget through the day.\nThe screen capture at http://vim.eralston.net/?id=navajo should help you\ndecide whether this colorscheme is right for you.\n\nYour first impression may be that the background is kinda ugly,\nand I guess that's probably true.  But hey, I find it much more\nreadable, and it sure beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.\nIt works well in the gui, and to get a similar background\nin a color xterm, start your xterm with\n\"xterm -bg NavajoWhite3 -fg black\"\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask; but to save you the\ntime and effort, the answer will invariably be 42.",
