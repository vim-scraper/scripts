The words will get converted like this:\n\n  on -> off\n  On -> Off\n  ON -> OFF\n \nany other case gets converted to lowercase, e.g.:\n\n  tRUe -> false\n\nInspired from vimscript #1676\nAll I really wanted besides what that script did, was the ability to\npreserve the case of words.\n\nUsage:\nOnce installed it will give you a ToggleWord() command and will map it by\ndefault to \"<leader>t\". All you need to do is position the cursor over the word\nyou want to toggle and press \\t in normal or visual mode.\n",

Suggestions for\n   adding more entries to the default dictionary are welcome;\n\n - Changed the way that the user defined (g:toggle_words) \n   dictionary works: it now gets merged into the default one,\n   so you can simply skip the entries already defined in the\n   base dictionary unless you need to override them.\n\n - Retired the 'ruby' version of the plugin. You can fetch it from v1.3\n   if you need it, but no further development will be done on it"
