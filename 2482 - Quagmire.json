Due to some fundamental differences in the way the two editors handle syntax highlighting, it's more or less impossible to make it a perfect match, but it's close enough to look fairly nice in most circumstances.\n\nBy the way, the original can be found on the TextMate wiki: http://wiki.macromates.com/Themes/UserSubmittedThemes\n\n",
