  "description": "Activity log is a plugin which simply logs what you're doing and when. For the latest version, to report a problem, or contact the author please visit https://github.com/AD7six/vim-activity-log\n\nWhat does it do:\n\nif you open and save a file, it'll create a log entries such as the following:\n\n    2011-02-09 08:44:16;open;/home/andy/someproject/somefile\n    2011-02-09 08:44:44;write;/home/andy/someproject/somefile\n    ...\n\nIf you're in a git repository at the time, it'll also log the current branch at the time of writing, for example:\n\n\n    2011-02-09 08:44:16;open;/home/andy/someproject/somefile\n    2011-02-09 08:44:44;write;/home/andy/someproject/somefile;special-stuff\n    ...\n\nWhy:\n\nThe main purpose of this plugin is to make time reporting easy for the forgetful programmer, without additional tools it provides a static log for you, but the format is such that you can easily import or analyze using whatever tool you feel comfortable with.\n",
  "install_details": "save activity-log.vim to your vim/plugin dir.\n\nIf desired, you can change how your logs are generated by defining g:activity_log_location in your vimrc for example to get monthly logs rather than daily logs:\n\n let g:activity_log_location = '/some/location/monthlylogs/%Y/%m.log'",
