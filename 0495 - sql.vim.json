Simply rename it to sql.vim to keep the default behaviour.\n\nSupports a wide variety of syntax including standard the standards: IF, LOOP, CASE.\nBut it will also support less used syntax like the EXCEPTION statement.\n\n\n",

Most programming languages allow you to use SQL (.Net, Java, PHP, Ruby, Javascript, ...) you can set the filetype to SQL temporarily and flip it back (once).  After that, you can use OMNI SQL completion.  Doing this quick filetype switch while using the SQL Anywhere indent script reported an error indicating IsLineComment function already exists.  This corrects the problem by making these routines script functions instead of public."
