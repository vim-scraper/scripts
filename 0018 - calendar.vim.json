  "description": "Requires the Unix command program 'cal' or its equivalent.  Really only provides a way of pulling up a calendar into a buffer in Vim.  The script opens a buffer if one doesn't exist.  The buffer is set up to be readonly and not modified (or modifiable if 6.0 or better).  Should work for both 5.7 and 6.0x.\n\nUsage is:  Cal 2001   | \" for current year calendar\n              Cal 4 2001 | \" for April of 2001 month  calendar",
  "install_details": "Copy to directory of your choice, make sure the 'cal' is in your path, and source it from your .vimrc.",
