  "description": "This is (yet?) another way to implement hypertext styling linking in plain text files (a.k.a. source code).\n\nThe notation is extremely simple and easy to type (and comprehend at a glance): |FileName|@|SearchString| (even easier to understand at a glance with highlighting: see the Colors section of textlink.vim for details)\n\nThe format of a textlink is | filename to load_fullpath |@| text to search for |\n\n\nBasically this is just :split FileName, gg, /SearchString. (ok very basically). You can omit loading of the file or searching for the SearchString if you like via the provided commands. You may also :vsplit if you like.\n\n\nCOMMANDS:\n:TTL\n    Mnemonic: test text link\n    Test text link. (echos the found FileName and SearchString)\n\n:TL\n    Mnemonic: text link\n    :split, :edit FileName, gg, /SearchString (basically). This is to say splits the current window and loads the specified file name then searches for the specified SearchString from the top of the file.\n\n:TLF\n    Mnemonic: text link file\n    Like :TL save ignores the SearchString... basically a short cut to :split and gf\n\n:TLS\n    Mnemonic: text link string (or search)\n    Like :TL save ignores the FileName... useful when FileName is |T|\n    (this file) and you do not want to split the window.\n\n\n:TTL\n    Mnemonic: test text link\n    Test text link. (echos the found FileName and SearchString)\n\n:VTL\n:VTLF\n:VTLS\n    Same as the above commands save :vsplit vs :split.\n\n\nEXAMPLES:\n|T|@|Examples:|\n    This will search for 'Examples:' in this file (T for this). useful with either :TL or :TLS\n\n|A|@|Examples:|\n    This will search for 'Examples:' in the AlternateFile (A for alternate) from a.vim, see NOTE below. ? Wonderful for leaving notes about a function in a header file for instance.\n\n|$VIM/vimfiles/plugin/textlink.vim|@|\" Examples:|\n    Environmental variables are expanded in the FileName portion, thanks to VIM :) In fact any(?) valid vim filename will work for FileName, I believe.\n\nSee: |~\\cvs.html|@|if(somenum < 25 || somenum > 15)|, pretty cool eh?\n    Although there can only be a single TextLink on any given line, it can appear anywhere in that line. (this is due to the greedy matching of the searchstring bars... to allow such a search string as this example..\n\n\nNOTE\nPlease see the comments in the file for more information and stuffs.\n\nAlso this can (and is setup to) use a.vim by Mike Sharpe (http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=31)\n\nThis works well enough to use everyday (I do) however there are probably a few quirks in it yet. (we all know how that goes ;) )\n\nI hope this is as useful to you as it is to me :)\n\n\nAlso of note (text hyperlinking) see  Stefan Bittner's http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=293\n\n\nHappy VIMing!\n\nRemoved buggy/broken versions below, as there was no reason to use them (they were buggy!). I believe 1.32 is (finaly stable, sorry for all the bugs in the first place!)",
  "install_details": "To install simply drop into your plug in directory.\nLoad VIM and add text links (|Filename|@|searchstring|) to your files...\nThen place your cursoe on the line (anywhere on the line) and :TL (or one of the other commands) when you want to transverse the textlink.\n\nTo remove, simple delete or rename textlink.vim from ye plugin directory.",
