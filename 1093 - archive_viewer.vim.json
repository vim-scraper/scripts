  "description": "\"   Initially based on tar.vim by Michael C. Toren\n\"   Other than the initial autocommands and some function\n\"   layouts, very little is the same.\n\"\n\" Platform:\n\"   Linux:\n\"     All testing done on linux so it should work fine in linux\n\"     environments that satisfy the dependencies below.\n\"   Windows (Cygwin):\n\"     Works in conjunction with cygwin_utils.vim plugin.\n\"     Make sure to read the Description comments in cygwin_utils.vim for\n\"     configuration instructions and other notes.\n\"\n\" Dependencies:\n\"   - unzip: must support -c (extract to stdout)\n\"   - zip: to edit files in a jar, war, ear, rar, sar, zip\n\"   - tar: must support -O (extract to stdout), -j (for bz2),\n\"     -z (for tgz, gz, Z)\n\"   - table_format.vim (tested with version 1.0) or\n\"     Align.vim (tested with version 26 ) for formatting\n\"     archive file layout\n\"   - Viewing of .class files from archives depends on the following\n\"     mapping (in vimrc or elsewhere) being loaded\n\"     (and of course having jad installed):\n\"       \"view java class files with jad\n\"       augr class\n\"         au!\n\"         au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class %!jad -noctor -ff -i -p -t2 -b %\n\"         au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent set readonly\n\"         au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent set ft=java\n\"         au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent normal gg=G\n\"         au bufreadpost,filereadpost *.class silent set nomodified\n\"       augr END\n\"\n\" Usage:\n\"   To start the viewer\n\"     vim a_tar_file.tar\n\"\n\"   To view a file or nested archive, simple hit enter on the line for\n\"   that file.\n\"\n\"   - To add a file to an archive hit \"a\", and follow the prompts.\n\"   - To edit a file in an archive hit \"e\" while viewing the file, edit\n\"     it and save it with \":w\".\n\"   - To delete a file hit \"r\" on the line for that file.  To delete more\n\"     than one file, simple use visual mode (V) to select the files to\n\"     delete.\n\"   - To extract a file hit \"x\" on the line for that file.  To extract more\n\"     than one file, simple use visual mode (V) to select the files to\n\"     extract.\n\"   - To extract the entire archive use \"X\".\n\"\n\"   For jar files there is also a global function \"ViewJarUrl(url,wincmd)\",\n\"   that takes a java standard jar url, and vim window commands to open\n\"   a file.\n\"   The format of the url is\n\"     jar:{url}!{file}\n\"   Ex.\n\"     jar:file:///home/myusr/myjar.jar!/adir/afile.txt\n\"\n\"   Currently, only \"file:\" urls are supported (not \"http:\", \"ftp:\", etc).\n\"\n\"   Ex. Usage of ViewJarUrl() to open a file in a new maximized window.\n\"     call ViewJarUrl(\"jar:file:///home/myusr/myjar.jar!/adir/afile.txt\",\n\"       \\ \"new | winc _\")\n\"\n\" Configuration:\n\"\n\"   g:ArchiveViewerPrompt\n\"     Defaults to 1.  Determines if prompts are used to capture\n\"     the directory name for extraction and adding files.  When\n\"     set to 1 prompts (using the input() function of vim) are used.\n\"     When set to 0, a : command is initiated for you that you can\n\"     complete to execute the action.\n\"\n\"     When hitting 'x' or 'X' to extract files the following : command\n\"     is initiated...\n\"       :ExtactTo \n\"     Simply supply the directory to extract to after that and hit\n\"     enter to execute.\n\"\n\"     When hitting 'a' to add files the following : command is initiated...\n\"       :AddFilesFrom \n\"     Supply the directory to start in (the directory that all added files\n\"     should be relative to) and hit enter.  You will then be prompted for\n\"     the files to add.\n\"\n\"     This was added because vim's input() function does not have\n\"     path completion, but : commands do.\n\"\n\"     Ex. let g:ArchiveViewerPrompt = 0\n",
