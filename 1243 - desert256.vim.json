  "description": "These are the colors of the \"desert\" theme by Hans Fugal with a few small modifications (namely that I lowered the intensity of the normal white and made the normal and nontext backgrounds black), modified to work with 88- and 256-color xterms.\n\nThe original \"desert\" theme is available as part of the vim distribution or at http://hans.fugal.net/vim/colors/.\n\nThe real feature of this color scheme, with a wink to the \"inkpot\" theme, is the programmatic approximation of the gui colors to the palettes of 88- and 256- color xterms.  The functions that do this (folded away, for readability) are calibrated to the colors used for Thomas E. Dickey's xterm (version 200), which is available at http://dickey.his.com/xterm/xterm.html.\n\nI struggled with trying to parse the rgb.txt file to avoid the necessity of converting color names to #rrggbb form, but decided it was just not worth the effort.  Maybe someone seeing this may decide otherwise...",
