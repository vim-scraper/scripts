  "description": "Inspired from other scripters. Thanks.\n\nThis utility was created because of needs as others. My job requires log\nmining. Sometimes I need to highlight specific lines and moving between \nthem for comparison. Most of my colleagues use UltraEdit which has this\ncapability which made me to find a way to add this capability to Vim.\n\nWhat does this utility do?\nIt highlights and marks the line under cursor. Then you'll be able to move\nbetween these marks easily. Unfortunately it is just limited to 3 marks because of my lack of coding knowledge.\n\nStep 1 - Just highlight and mark the line with CTRL+F2, CTRL+F3 or CTRL+F4. \nStep 2 - Then use F2, F3 and F4 to move between these marks. \nStep 3 - Use SHIFT+CTRL+F2, SHIFT+CTRL+F3 and SHIFT+CTRL+F4 to reset the related mark and highlight.\nStep 4 - use cm in normal mode to reset all highlights and marks\n\nIt is that simple.",
