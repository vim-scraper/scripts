  "description": "A custom text object for selecting quoted text. It depends on awesome Kana's https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user. \n\n\nvim-textobj-quoted gives you two new text-objects: \n\n* iq\nThat stands for Inner Quoted\n* *_aq_*\nThat stands for Around Quoted\n\nSo, the two text-objects defined will work with the following quoting chars:\n\n* { }\n* \" \"\n* ' '\n* ( )\n\nPlease note that the defined text-objects are single-line oriented. I find them very useful in situations like the following (* indicated cursor position): \n\n* \"some awes*ome text\"\n* (some awes*ome text)\n* {some awes*ome text}\n* 'some awes*ome text'\n\nIn each case you could use commands like viq or ciq and select/cancel all the quoted text. Obviously, you can achive the same results using commands like vi\" or vi{. Indeed, the real benefit you'll get using this plugin is that you will have to remember only the q char.",
