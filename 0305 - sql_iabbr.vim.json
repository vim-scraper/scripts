  "description": "With this ftplugin you can type \"create table foo (foo_id int);\" and get \"CREATE TABLE foo (foo_id INT);\".  It is based on both sql.vim and the output from postgresql's \\dT command while in psql.  That makes it a tad bit tailored to postgresql, but it will work with any SQL compliant dbms.  Please note that I am not an SQL wizard.  I just know how to copy and paste and use \":%s///\".  :)  Enjoy!  Comments are welcome.  Many thanks to Hari Krishna Dara for improving this plugin and making it generally more useful.",
