The prototypes within it are based on gcc's /usr/share/man/man2 directory.\n\nThis plugin is truly simple to use: after one has typed a function name, a protype \"hint\" will be shown.\n \nex.    select(\n\n       will result in\n\n          int select(int nfds, fd_set * readfds, fd_set * writefds, fd_set * exceptfds, struct timeval * utimeout)\n\n       being echo'd at the bottom of the display.\n\nYou'll probably want your cmdheight option set to at least two (ie.  set ch=2). \n\n(see vimscript#1826 for man-3 based function hints)",
