  "description": "A random collection of vim files I use. Containing syntax files for C, C# and Java featuring syntax based folding support. Also contains highlighting for doxygen comments in C and C#. And contains a simple syntax highligher for NSIS.\n\nUsage for folding in C, C++, C# and Java: First of all { code blocks; }  are recognized. Should cover most language constructs, like classes, functions, branches, loops. Additonally explicitly defined regions are supported. In C# you use pairs for \"#region/#endregion\" pragmas for that purpose. In C (and C++) explicit regions are marked by \"/* region */\" and \"/* endregion */\". The region markers for Java are \"// region\" and \"//endregion\".\n\n",
