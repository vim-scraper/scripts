  "description": "This color scheme is for GUI only, although it contains some tweaks for the console version of Vim, too. It is not too complicated and its highlights are supposed to be cheerful, friendly to your eyes, and easy to read. Though all niceties can only bee seen in Vim 7, this color scheme should work in Vim 6, too.\n\nSince version 1.1 it contains not only a light color scheme, but also a dark one. The correct scheme is being chosen according to the setting of the option 'background'.\n\nYou can switch between these styles by using the :Colo command, like \":Colo light\" or \":Colo dark\"",
  "install_details": "Just put it in \"~/.vim/colors\" or in \"<your vim directory>\\vimfiles\\colors\" on Windows. Do \":colo earendel\" to apply it. If you want to install it as your default color scheme, just add \"colo earendel\" to your vimrc file.\n\nIf your background is dark, the dark mode of this scheme will be loaded (and vice versa). If the scheme doesn't load the mode being preferred by you, just add one of the following to your vimrc file:\n\nset background=dark\nset background=light",
