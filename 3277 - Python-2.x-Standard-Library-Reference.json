  "description": "Installing this help file will give you access to the Python 2.7 standard library documentation as a Vim help file (available from within Vim by typing \":help py2stdlib\"). For this release I've only tagged the module names (otherwise the help tagspace becomes too cluttered).  I have also left a lot of RST syntax decorations (e.g., backticks, bold) intact to preserve table alignment etc. If you have any suggestions for improvement or find areas in the documentation that need to be fixed, please let me know.",
  "install_details": "1. Download the file.\n2. Change to your $VIMRUNTIME directory (e.g., \"cd ~/.vim\").\n3. Unarchive the file (e.g., \"unzip ~/Downloads/py2stdlib.zip\").\n4. Change to the \"doc\" subdirectory (e.g., \"cd doc\").\n5. Rebuild the tags: \"vim -c  \":helptags . | :q\"",
