  "install_details": "* Supported os:\n  - Linux/UNIX\n* Install:\n  - copy the archive somewhere in your Vim path (usually /usr/share/vim/addons/plugin if you've got root permissions  or ~/.vim/plugin). You can also put it anywhere as long as you keep  'vimblinkcursor' and 'vimstopblinking' along with blink_cursor.vim. In this case switch the script on manually into Vim with:\n          :so /path/to/the/script/blinking_cursor.vim\n\n  - untar the archive:\n          $ tar -zxvf blinking_cursor.tar.gz\n\n  - Make sure that your terminal isn't set to make the cursor blink (in gnome-terminal : Edit=>Current Profile...). If you want to keep the cursor blinking while not using vim, you can add this line in your ~/.bashrc file :\n            /full/path/to/the/script/vimblinkcursor&\nand in your ~/.vimrc:\n            augroup blinking_cursor\n            au!    \n            au VimLeave * :silent! ! /full/path/to/the/scriptvimblinkcursor&\n            augroup END\n\n  - If it doesn't work as expected, or if you are not on a i386-arch computer, compile vimblinkcursor and stopblinking sources again:\n           $ gcc vimblinkcursor.c -o vimblinkcursor\n           $ gcc vimstopblinking.c -o vimstopblinking\n\n  - If it still does not work properly, please e-mail me\n* TODO:\n  - let the user set the blinking delays\n  - let the user switch the script on/off \n  - port to windows ( i don't think i can do it myself _I've got only an uninstalled win95 copy_. If someone can, please e-mail me ) \n* Thanks\n  - blinking_cursor.vim uses blink.c by Bram Moolenaar (provided with vim in /tools)\n",
