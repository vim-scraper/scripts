  "description": "This is a modification of vimscript #1537 to make it work with centralized backup directories. Backups are saved by default in $HOME/.backups, with recursive subdirectories reflecting the original location of the file being saved, using the VMS versioning system.\n\nParts of the script running under VMS were not changed. Script was tested on Linux, and should work in other environments too (Windows, Mac).",
