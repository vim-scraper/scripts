  "description": "I was editing an HTML file written by several developers over the course of a\nfew years. They contained tags like (yes, literally!)\n        <table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=\"0\" border='0'>\n        <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=0 border='0'>\n        <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0>\n\nThey're all basically the same table definition, but the attributes are\nswitched around and the attribute values are formatted differently each time.\n(Thank the multiple developers, each with their own style.) Running HTML Tidy\nwasn't an option because I didn't want to create a huge diff in version\ncontrol that indicated a lot of changes where I didn't actually change\nanything. Thus, this plugin.\n\nThe commands and functions defined in this script will match any XML/HTML\nelement/tag with the specified attributes and values.\n",
