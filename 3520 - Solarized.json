It supports GUI full color, 256 color terminal mode and 16 color terminal mode (use Solarized terminal colorschemes with the latter for optimal results; see project homepage above).\n\nIt has been built on a foundation of eight monotones with precise CIELAB lightness relations. These monotones relations are symmetric, allowing for use in light and dark modes withÂ identical readability.",
