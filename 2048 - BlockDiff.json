  "description": "This script provides a simple and fast way to see the difference between two blocks of text.\nThis might be similar source code functions, definitions, etc.\n\nJust select the first portion, goto Menu \"Tools->BlockDiff->This is block 1\".\nSelect the second portion, goto Menu \"Tools->BlockDiff->This is block 2, start diff\".\nThe script will open a new tab, split it and diff the two portions.\n\nIf you prefer the mouse context-menu, a key mapping or ex commands, they all are prepared in the file, just remove the comment and/or change the mappings.\n\nCurrently only for Vim 7.* with GUI (and tabs).
