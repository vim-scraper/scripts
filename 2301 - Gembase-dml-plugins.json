  "description": "This package includes three scripts, a syntax script, an auto-indentation file and a ftplugin, which mainly provides omni-completion, suited declaration auto-completion and some accessorial functionalities.\n\n1. Syntax highlight\n-------------------------\n\nHighlighted language-elements listed as below:\n\n    (1) preprocessing statement;\n    (2) comment;\n    (3) six kinds of forms and its end_form keyword;\n    (4) six kinds of blocks and its end_block keyword;\n    (5) structure such as if, while and case statement, and highlighted their adjacent parenthesis;\n    (6) operator, constant and quote;\n    (7) system variable and user-defined variable;\n    (8) all qualifiers of form and block;\n    (9) most of metadata keywords.\n\n2. Auto-indentation\n--------------------------\n\nIn the insert mode, it will auto-indent form, block, structures and continuous lines marked with character &. In the normal mode, you can use it to check codes validity (hit keys: \"gg=G\"). Some mismatched keywords and abuse of character \"&\" were found in dml files when I run it.\n\nBy default, shiftwidth equals to 4 spaces (If you need a tab with 8 spaces, try to hit \"ctrl + v + tab), value of syntactic indent equals to shiftwidth, and continue line marked with character \"&\" indents 8 spaces (you can configure it by changing the variable \"s:slip\" in indent script). \n\n3. ftplugin\n-------------\n\nThis script provides several useful functionalities, the most useful two are:\n\n     (1) in the insert mode, it provide both omni-completion and known-word-completion functionality by a function \"SuperCleverTab()\". It is very convenient, when you hit key \"Tab\", vim will pop a balloon to lists all candidate keywords, use \"CTRL + N\" or \"CTRL + P\" to move focus, use \"CTRL + Y\" to pick up a candidate and \"CTRL + E\" to return original status. If you want to print a \"Tab\", just try \"CTRL + V + Tab\". You can also manually remap the hot-key, besides, an menu item also provides to execute it;\n     (2) in the insert mode, it will auto-complete suited declaration keywords after its beginning was inputed, for instance, if you input string \"BEGIN_BLOCK?\", NOTICE: the keyword must be followed by a question mark \"?\", then hit a space, system will auto-complete \"END_BLOCK\";\n\nOthers are some accessorial enhancements:\n\n     (3) set comments to format dashed line with leader character \"!\" when hitting <CR> or using \"o\";\n     (4) set hot-keys to support fast jumping among blocks by using \"]]\" (next \"BEGIN_BLOCK\"), \"[[\" (previous \"BEGIN_BLOCK\"), \"][\" (next \"END_BLOCK\"), \"[]\" (previous \"END_BLOCK\"), and among comments by using \"]!\" (next comment) and \"[!\" (previous comment);\n     (5) support \"matchit\" plugin to jump between keywords within a structure by hitting key \"%\" in normal mode. Such as \"IF\" -> \"ELSE_IF\" -> \"ELSE\" -> \"END_IF\", etc.\n     (6) also provides parenthesis auto-completion;\n     (7) if you runs in GUI, it provides a menu column, which lists some functional item;\n     (8) if you runs in GUI and made a folder, when cursor hangs over it, then system will display a help tip to show the less than 30 lines within folder;\n     (9) provide a quick approach to comment or uncomment selected lines by GUI menu.\n\n4. Upgrade\n---------------\n\nBy default, GetLatestVimScripts plugin is included in Vim installation package, whose version is higher than v7. So you can use it to auto-download the newest package. Add below line into file \"GetLatestVimScripts.dat\":\n\n                           2301 1 gembase-plugins\n\nand use this command \":GetLatestVimScripts\" to upgrade it.\n\n5. TODO\n------------\n\n     (1) when handling an ending statement, check its mate to decide whether indent;\n     (2) support fast jumping and matchit switching between six kinds of forms;\n     (3) normalize syntax format of current line before open a new line;\n     (4) assemble the results of keyword-completion and context-completion together.\n\n6. Acknowledgments\n----------------------------\n\nI would like to thank Kim Schulz, without his excellent book \"Hacking Vim\", I can't complete ftplugin script in a few days.",
