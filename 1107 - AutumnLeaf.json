  "description": "The colors of a Finnish autumn morning captured and packed in a nice color scheme which is light orange/blue/green and doesn't strain the eye.\n\nThis scheme was created to serve more as a tool for users who work with code such as C/C++ or Perl. Also handy with XHTML/HTML/CSS and why not plain text too.\n\nRich syntax highlightings, cterm supported.\n\nScreenshot here: http://safelyinrussia.com/tmp/miikka/autumnleaf.png",
  "install_details": "A) UNIX/Linux: Download to ~/.vim/colors/.\nB) Win32: Download to <vim directory>/vimfiles/colors/.\n\nOpen Vim, type :colors AutumnLeaf. If you like the theme, edit your _vimrc (Win) or .vimrc (Un*x) and add this line:\n    colorscheme AutumnLeaf\nthus making this scheme your default one.\n",
