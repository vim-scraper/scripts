  "description": "This is a very low saturation version based on default and torte colour scheme.  It looks only little different from syntax turned off, and is good for long-time works.\n\nThis colour scheme can work for both 'light' and 'black' backgrounds.  Use \"set background=...\" to switch the different styles.\n\nBasically, it is designed for GUI, but it can fallback to a colourful mode in low-colour terminals.\n",
