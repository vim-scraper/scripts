  "description": "Tired of trying thousand of tools to organize my life, and inspired in the\nidea of ONE BIG TEXT FILE from Danny O'Brien, I decided that the world needed\nyet another GTD tool. The \"Almighty\" part is a reference to the idea of having\nall type of notes about your tasks in one single file.\n\nThe whole idea of this GTD implementation relies in some custom notation\nmarks, the Folding capabilities of VIM and its power to work quickly with\ntext. I wanted something portable to collect, edit, search and structure\nlightning fast my notes.\n\nYou can get a longer description and one screenshot at:\n\nhttps://github.com/fgarcia/agtd\n",
