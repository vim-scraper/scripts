  "description": "This plug-in aims to improve the integration between Vim and its environment by providing functions to switch to full-screen (see the screenshots at http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/screenshots), open URLs in the user's default web browser and execute external commands in the background without opening a command prompt window. A DLL is included to perform these things on Windows, while on UNIX external commands are used.\n\nFor more information about the plug-in please refer to its homepage or the project page on GitHub:\n\n  http://peterodding.com/code/vim/shell/\n  http://github.com/xolox/vim-shell\n\nIf you have questions, bug reports, suggestions, etc. the author can be contacted at peter@peterodding.com. If you like this plug-in please vote for it below!\n\nALTERNATIVES\nAfter publishing this plug-in I found that vimscript #687 and vimscript #2596 also implement full-screen on Windows using a similar approach. I prefer the effect of my plug-in because it seems to hide window decorations more effectively. Also note that my plug-in was developed independently of the other two.",
  "install_details": "Unzip the most recent ZIP archive file (see below) inside your Vim profile directory (usually this is \"~/.vim\" on UNIX and \"%USERPROFILE%\\vimfiles\" on Windows), restart Vim and execute the command \":helptags ~/.vim/doc\" (use \":helptags ~\\vimfiles\\doc\" instead on Windows). Now try it out:\n\n  Press <F11> or execute :Fullscreen to switch to full-screen mode and back;\n\n  Press <F6> or execute :Open to open files, directories, URLs and e-mail addresses using their associated default programs. By default the filename/URL/etc. under the text cursor is used, but you can also give an argument to the :Open command, for example:\n\n    :Open $VIMRUNTIME\n    :Open http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3123",
