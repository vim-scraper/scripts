Nonetheless, this file aims to be backwards compatible with classic VB, although some deprecated VB syntax may be flagged as an error.\n\nFolding is supported. Try \":set foldmethod=syntax\".\n\nI haven't done any VB since that one semester in college. I'd appreciate someone taking over this file and submitting it to be included in Vim. I believe it to be a rename and :%s/vbnet/vb/g away from being a far superior replacement for the vb.vim included with Vim, but it is terrible at VBScript, which vb.vim also handles.\n",
  "install_details": "Copy vbnet.vim to your syntax directory (.vim/syntax or vimfiles/syntax in your home directory).  To activate it, use the command \":set ft=vbnet\".\n\nThe following autocmd can be added to your vimrc to automatically set the filetype (and activate syntax highlighting) for all VB.NET files.\n\nautocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.vb set ft=vbnet",
