  "description": "Inspired by the Info browser script, I present this script for bowsing html documentaion offline in a vim buffer via lynx. \n\n:Lynx index.html will create your buffer, then browsing is a matter of using the usual \"tag\" keys Ctrl-] and Ctrl-T. A link is indicated by lynx as a number in square brackets. Place the cursor over this (on the '[') and use Ctrl-] to follow the link.\n\nIt probably could be tidied up and also follow http: links as well as file: links but this is all I need to browse the wxPython docs offline which was what I wrote it for. Improvements welcome.\n\nThis has been tested on a Slackware 9.1 box with Vim 6.2. YMMV.\n",
