  "description": "This small Python plugin is a translation of the Emacs 'bruce' utility (formerly known as 'spook'). It adds key words and phrases one might expect in a e-mail spying program to the end of the current buffer in the form of a signature, in order to confuse such programs. I didn't write it so much to make a statement as to relieve boredom for a few minutes, but the issue is important.\n\nIncludes a terrible Swedish translation of the README.",

  "install_details": "Installation is relatively simple. Copy bruce.vim to global or local plugin directory. You'll need a data file, ~/.bruce.lines of course, which consists of special words and phrases, separated by newlines; otherwise Python will raise an error. I included a good example from Emacs with small changes.",
