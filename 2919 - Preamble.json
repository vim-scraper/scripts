  "description": "This plugin will automatically fold long preambles, such as GPL copyright\nnotices, located at the head of source files.  You may find it helpful if,\nlike me, you use syntax folding infrequently. \n\nVery often, I read third-party library sources and examples, such as Nokia's\nQt library, various GNU utilities, and many others.  I want to see the \nfunctions and read the comments but not the 50 lines of licensing and \ncopyright notices that head every file. Because these are third-party \nsources, I do not want to modify the files to include Vim fold markers.\n\nWHAT IT DOES:\n\nThis plugin does not use fold markers and does not modify files.\nIt adds the fold by changing the foldmethod to \"manual\" and inserting a \nmanual fold. \n\nIf the foldmethod is 'syntax', the plugin will do nothing except try to \nclose the fold on line 1, if one exists.  No fold is created and the\nfoldmethod is not changed.\n\nThe preamble has to start at the top of the file, but may be preceded by \nempty lines.  It will consist of leading blank lines followed by lines \nwith comments starting in column one. The preamble will stop at the first line\nnot having a comment in the first column.  \n\nNote: If the preamble uses 'c' style comments without a border of characters\nin column 1 the preamble will not be recognized. \n\n",
