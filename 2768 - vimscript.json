  "description": "Experiment to enable vim being invoked as a script interpreter, even when the vimscript block in question is used within a  unix pipe.\n\nThis is basically my take on the original vimscript#1069 vimsh from 2004,  sufficiently mangled until it finally did mostly work again with unix pipes and using vim 7.2 (excluding the g//p issue, where the prints  get replicated all over the place - drop me a line if you have an idea). \n\nNote that vim still does some unnecessary screen redrawing if it is connected to a  tty, however I\nactually  managed  to run a vimscript even from a cronjob, much to  my surprise.\n\nFurther information and example vimscript blocks: see --help.\n\nI'll intend to keep this somewhat uptodate, at least until vim can be run non-interactively without the requirements for such a hack.\n\nThe current version is available from:\nhttp://jakobi.github.com/script-archive-doc/\nhttp://github.com/jakobi/script-archive/tree/master/vim/",
