  "description": "DrillCtg allows drill-down search by character across the pathnames in your current loaded ctags file.  Upon first launching DrillCtg, if a ctags file is currently set, it will parse it and create a Vim list (an array).  This is a sorted array which contains all unique pathnames, able to searched quickly using Vim's match() function.\n\nIt uses Vim's complete-functions to provide a dynamically populated list of values which are updated on every keypress.  You can then select which pathname to open.\n\nIf a ctags file is not currently set upon launching DrillCtg, it will prompt you for the location of one.\n\nIf you set a different ctags file, upon the next call to DrillCtg, it will replace the contents of the old array with the new pathnames.\n\nCurrently this plugin only supports 1 loaded ctags file at a time.  If you have more than 1 ctags file loaded, it is likely that this plugin will not work.\n\nI created this plugin because I wanted something similar to Eclipse's Navigate > Go To > Resource dialog box.  I find this implementation a lot faster than Eclipse when dealing with several thousand unique pathnames.\n\nDrillCtg requires Vim 7.",
