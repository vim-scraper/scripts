Change to the $HOME/.vim/doc or $HOME/vimfiles/doc or $VIM/vimfiles/doc\n    directory, start Vim and run the \":helptags .\" command to process the\n    taglist help file. Without this step, you cannot jump to the taglist help\n    topics.\n3. If the exuberant ctags utility is not present in your PATH, then set the\n    Tlist_Ctags_Cmd variable to point to the location of the exuberant ctags\n    utility (not to the directory) in the .vimrc file.\n4. If you are running a terminal/console version of Vim and the terminal\n    doesn't support changing the window width then set the\n    'Tlist_Inc_Winwidth' variable to 0 in the .vimrc file.\n5. Restart Vim.\n6. You can now use the \":TlistToggle\" command to open/close the taglist\n    window. You can use the \":help taglist\" command to get more information\n    about using the taglist plugin.\n",
