I doubt there are big changes in 3, but let me know.\n\nI prefixed syntax items with \"mk_\" because Pro/E files are largely used for 'Mapkeys'.\nHowever, some of the syntax items here apply to general Pro/E syntax.\n\nThere is no vocabulary built in.  I was unable to download a good list of commands.  This documentation for Wildfire 2 is in PDF form, and translating to text and HTML both fail miserably for me.\n http://www.cad-resources.com/WF2_configuration_options.pdf\n\nI'm confused as to why the tildes ~ and the 'mapkey(continued) ' markings were necessary to the syntax... thoughts, anyone?\n",
