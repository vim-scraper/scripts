  "description": "See also:\n\nvimscript#474\nvimscript#147\n\nDescription:\n\nBased on ideas from the above two plugins, but also adds the following features:\n * Word completion in a regular command line. (in addition to word completion in a search command line)\n * Word completion in the middle of the command line. (not just the end of the command line)\n\nTo use, hit F12 while in the command line. Hit F12 again to get a different completion. Repeated invocations will cycle through all possible completions. Word completion will be done in the context of the current buffer.\n\nCustomization:\n\nTo inhibit loading of this plugin, define the loaded_cmdline_compl variable.\n\nTo change the key mapping, cmap the desired key to <Plug>CmdlinecomplComplete. For example:\n\n    cmap <F11> <Plug>CmdlinecomplComplete\n",
