  "description": "It is a common practice to insert header guards into C/C++ header files to\nallow a header to be included multiple times.  A header guard for file\nHeaderName.h typically looks something like this: >\n\n  #ifndef HEADERNAME_H\n  #define HEADERNAME_H\n\n    ...header content...\n\n  #endif /* HEADERNAME_H */\n\nThis plugin provides the following command:         *HeaderguardAdd*  >\n\n  :HeaderguardAdd                                   \n\nThis will add a new header guard to the current file.  It checks for a\npre-existing header guard, and if found, modifies the existing guard in-place.  \n\nDetection of pre-existing header guards is somewhat primitive.  The first two\npre-processor directives in the file must be the pre-existing header guard's\n#ifndef (or #if !defined()) and #define directives, and the final directive in\nthe file must be the corresponding #endif.  Pre-existing header guards not\nfollowing this form won't be recognized and thus cannot be converted in-place.\nTo avoid mistakenly adding another header guard with the same guard name,\n|HeaderguardAdd| will refuse to add a new header guard if it can find a\n#define of the guard name macro anywhere in the file.\n\nThe guard style may be configured; details on customization and more\nare found in the included documentation.",

The following files will\nbe unpacked: >\n\n  doc/headerguard.txt\n  plugin/headerguard.vim\n\nFinally, re-generate your help tags with the |:helptags| command, e.g.: >\n\n  :helptags ~/.vim/doc\n\nNote: This script may well work with versions of Vim prior to 7.0; I have not \ntried to test the script against anything older than 7.1.  If anyone can verify\nthat it works with earlier versions of Vim, let me know and I can adjust the\ncompatibility field accordingly.\n",
