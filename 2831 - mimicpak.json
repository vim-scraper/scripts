  "description": "The MimicPak is a set of 17 colorschemes which were converted (ripped-off)\nfrom other editors and IDEs and that use and share some common\ntweaking options, like the font style among others.  Some original,\npersonal, invented and cloned colorschemes are included too.\n\nThe IDEs/Editors may have had more colorschemes, but only some\n(which I think that were great) are included.  Most of the colorschemes\nare only for gVim, this is so, because of time reasons and available\nnumber of colors.  However, you can use the CSApprox plugin\n( vimscript#2390 ) to use them on 88/256 color terms.  Although some of them\nhave the cterm colors for 16 color terminals.\n\nFor a fast way to try out these schemes, the included mimicpak.vim\nplugin script creates a submenu \"MimicPak\" under the \"Themes\" menu on the main\nmenubar.\n\nAfter correctly installing this pack, you can see the help with:\n   :h mimicpak\n       >> to get general help\n   :h mimic-overview\n       >> quick overview of colorschemes by background colors.\n   :h mimic-options\n       >> to see the shared options.\n   :h name_of_scheme.vim   \n       >> to see specific options (if any) of a  particular colorscheme.\n\n================\nSHARED OPTIONS\n================\nAll the included colorschemes use and share the following common option\nvariables (these can either be set as: buffer, window, tabpage or global) :\n\n   * mimic_font_style:  controls the style of the fonts.\n\n        let  mimic_font_style = 0    \" schemes will use plain fonts\n        let  mimic_font_style = 1    \" schemes will use bold fonts\n        let  mimic_font_style = 2    \" schemes will use italic fonts\n        let  mimic_font_style = 3    \" schemes will use bold and italic fonts\n\n   * mimic_colorize_gui:  if set, GUI elements (menu, toolbar,\n        scrollbar) will be colorized (works only for some GUIs).\n\nThat said, you only need to set these options once and you'll get the\nsame look when changing to another of these schemes.\n\nFor further help about these, try:\n   :h mimic_font_style\n   :h mimic_colorize_gui\n\n==============\nSCREENSHOTS\n==============\nHere are some: http://img97.imageshack.us/g/scameemacsplain.png/\n\nA slideshow: http://img513.imageshack.us/slideshow/player.php?id=img513/5013/1256781939pe8.smil\n\nMost of the included colorschemes are intended to be \"easy on the eyes\"\n(well, almost) and I hope that you might find at least 2 or 3\ncolorschemes from this pack that you could use for every day coding :)\n\nIf you like it (or if you don't) PLEASE RATE this thing!\n",
  "install_details": "* For the compressed Vimball file (.vba.gz):\n  Just open it in Vim/gVim and then type:\n\n   :so %\n   :q\n\n  And that's all.\n\n[Windows users: you'll need to have gzip in your %PATH%].\n\n* For the zip file (.zip): extract them to a directory that is in your\n'runtimepath'.\n   On Unix/linux:  $HOME/.vim/\n   On Windows:  %USERPROFILE%\\vimfiles\\ or YOUR_VIM_INSTALLATION_PATH\\vimfiles\\\n\nThen open Vim/gVim and type:\n   :helptags THE_EXTRACTION_PATH/doc\n\nAfter correct installation, you can see the help with:\n   :h mimicpak\n   :h mimicpak-toc\n\nThat's all...
