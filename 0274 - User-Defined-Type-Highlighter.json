This will add the usr_include.vim file to your ftplugin/cpp directory.  There is no longer a need to source the file in your .vimrc, it will be sourced whenever you load up a C++ file.  You should move the udt.rb file to wherever you keep your scripts (ie. ~/bin).",

It is still *highly* recommend that you do move the files as suggested in the help file, but you now have the option to not move anything.  Updated the help files, and fixed some typos and other minor things."

You should still untar the archive in ~/.vim.  When you start up vim type \":helptags ~/.vim/doc\" then \":he udt\"."
