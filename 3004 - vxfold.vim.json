  "description": "This script implements a fold-cycling functionality similar to\nthe one in emacs org-mode.\n\nSubfolds are open/closed each time TAB or Shift-TAB is pressed.\nTAB operates on the lines below a heading that is in the current line.\nShift-TAB operates on the whole buffer.\n\nAfter each press a step in the following cycle will be performed:\n   1. fold closed\n   2. show direct subheadings\n   3. show structure below heading + first line of text\n   4. unfold all\n\n   NOTES: It is possible to skip step 2 and/or 3, but the per-buffer \n   configuration is still missing (I think emacs-org uses only 1-2-4). In step \n   2 the text under the current heading may be visible; this is because of\n   the way folding is implemented in Vim.\n\nFold cycling will work in buffers that are folded in the following way:\n  * headings have folding levels 1-9\n  * text has a folding level higher than 9\n\nThis means that the script can work with TVO (vimscript#517) without\nchanging the folding mode. To enable fold cycling in TVO mode:\n\n  :VxFoldTvo\n\nFor other modes the foldmethod has to be changed. Foldmethods are\nprovided for viki (vimscript#861) and vimwiki (vimscript#2226).\n\n  :VxFoldViki\n  :VxFoldVimWiki\n\nThe later commands will also work on any buffer that has the headings defined\nwith a number of characters at the beginning of line (viki='*', vimwiki='=').\n\nIf a file uses '#' characers to mark headings with levels, it is also possible\nto use fold cycling in it like this:\n\n  :call vxfold#SetFold_OrgBolCount('#')\n  :VxFoldTvo\n\nThe display of the folded text can be changed with\n\n  :call vxfold#SetFoldTextFirstLine()\n\nwhich is the default for VxFoldVimWiki and VxFoldViki.\n\nVersion 0.1 is less than 2 days old, so it is not perfect. It needs more\nwork especially the customization/command part.\n\nPlease report bugs/suggstions on the Vim/Wiki (link top right).\n\n",
