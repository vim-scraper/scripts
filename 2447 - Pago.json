  "description": "Pago is probably the most powerful terminal-based screenwriting script available for any platform, and allows the use of vim as a fully-functional piece of screenwriting software such as Final Draft or Celtx.  While some elements of the script are unstable, it undergoes daily testing and revision, becoming more mature as I use it every day for my own screenwriting projects.\n\nPLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH FEEDBACK if you use or test this software -- any comments or requested features will be given full consideration.  (zazaian (at) gmail (dot) com).  Your thoughts are essential to developing this program into a piece of software that best serves the open source community.\n\nOverview\n========\n* Supports all major formatting elements of a screenplay, based on both logical and commonly accepted conventions of the screenplay form.\n* Automatically enforces all boundaries within each screenplay element, ensuring proper formatting to the exact specifications of a screenplay.\n* Allows access to all six available screenplay ELEMENTS without any complex keyboard shortcuts or commands, using only the keys <Backspace>, <Tab>, <Enter>, <Up>, <Down>, <Left>, <Right>.\n* Allows easy cycling through blank screenplay elements using both the <Tab> and <Backspace> keys.\n\n  Features\n  ========\n  * Pressing TAB cycles through empty screenplay elements in the order:\n\n    ACTION --> DIALOGUE --> PARENTHETICAL --> CHARACTER --> TRANSITION --> ACTION\n\n    * Pressing <Tab> from a blank TRANSITION element will cycle back to the\n      beginning of the line, triggering a blank ACTION element.\n\n    * Parentheses are automatically inserted when calling a blank PARENTHETICAL\n      element.  Pressing <Tab> from within blank parentheses will automatically\n      delete the parentheses and jump to a blank CHARACTER element.\n\n    * A colon (\":\") is automatically inserted at the end of the line when an\n      TRANSITION element is called.  The cursor remains at the spot of the colon\n      when text is either entered or deleted.\n      \n      * Text typed within a TRANSITION element is automatically RIGHT-JUSTIFIED.\n\n      * Pressing <Enter> from a TRANSITION element jumps two lines down the page\n        and prompts a blank SCENE HEADING element.\n\n  * Pressing <Backspace> on an empty line cycles through empty screenplay elements\n    in the reverse order:\n\n    TRANSITION --> CHARACTER --> PARENTHETICAL --> DIALOGUE --> ACTION\n    --> END OF PREVIOUS ELEMENT\n\n    * Pressing <Backspace> from a blank line jumps to the end of the previous\n      element or, if the above two lines are blank, will create a blank ACTION\n      element two lines above the previous cursorline.\n    \n    * Pressing <Backspace> on a line with text will delete the character to the\n      left of the cursor.\n\n  * All text typed with a SCENE HEADING, CHARACTER, or TRANSITION element will be\n    automatically CAPITALIZED.\n\n  * To create a SCENE HEADING element, press enter while in a blank ACTION element.\n    The Cursorline will be HIGHLIGHTED and all text typed within the element will\n    be CAPITALIZED.\n\n  * While in a blank SCENE HEADING element:\n    * Press the <Space> bar to cycle through the common prefixes INT., EXT., and\n      INT./EXT.\n    * Press <Enter> to jump down two lines to a new, blank ACTION element.\n\n  * Active screenplay element is displayed in CAPS in the status bar.\n\n  * Page number is displayed in the status bar.  This estimates the number of pages\n    within your screeplay using a 56-line-per-page standard.\n\n  * Pressing <Up> in either INSERT or NORMAL modes jumps to the beginning of the\n    line above the cursorline.\n\n  * Pressing <Down> in either INSERT or NORMAL modes jumps to the end of the\n    line above the cursorline.\n\n  * Holding <Left> in either INSERT or NORMAL modes scrolls through to the\n    beginning of the current element, then jumps to the end of the previous\n    element.\n\n  * Holding <Right> in either INSERT or NORMAL modes scrolls through to the\n    end of the current element, then jumps to the beginning of the next\n    element.\n\n  * Typing text within a screenplay element such as DIALOGUE or ACTION will\n    automatically reformat the paragraph if text exceeds the preset end of the\n    line.  This improves upon use of the :tw (text width) and :wrap commands by\n    formatting text that is typed within a paragraph, rather than simply at the end\n    of it.\n\n\nPlanned Features\n==============\n* Easily output text file to a fully-formatted .PDF file.\n* Drop-Down lists for previously used:\n  * Character Names\n  * Character Parentheticals (O.S., O.C., V.O., CONT'D)\n  * Scene Headings\n* Integrated version control using the Bazaar version control system.\n  * Allows the use of a single file for a screenplay, rather than keeping multiple copies.\n  * Easily discern the differences between various writing sessions.\n  * Retain deleted scenes, lines and actions from various writing sessions.\n* Command-line abbreviations will simplify both version control and other useful features.\n* Optional syntax highlighting\n* Character and scene reports",
