  "description": "These tools provides support in gvim for TAL/pTAL source files with syntax highlighting and tags. HP NonStop (NSK) users who need to edit TAL/pTAL source files can use all features of gvim with the help of these tools. This is intended for use by developers when the source files have been copied to Windows. Reading and writing of files residing on NSK are not supported.\n\nSyntax highlighting is provided for TAL/pTAL source files, which helps in simplifying complicated code. A tool is provided for building tags for TAL/pTAL source files similar to the tags built by ctags for C code. This helps in easy navigation of multiple source files and jumping directly to procedure definitions.\n",
