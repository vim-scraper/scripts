  "install_details": "Simple source the script inside your .vimrc to register the needed macros. You may then use any macro name listed inside the first part of the script file with a backslash in front of it. Therefore just typing e.g. \"\\alpha \\beta \\gamma\" in insert mode would give you the Greek letters you want.\n\nYou may customize every mapping table to your linkings or add new ones. If you create new tables or extend the ones already present I would be grateful if you could send me a copy of your work, for everyone to benefit from.",
