  "description": "fitnesse.vim is a syntax file (and eventually some filetype specific functions) \nfor editing FitNesse tests using Vim.  It was created to make it easier to work\nwith FitNesse files.  It works great in conjunction with \"It's All Text\" a \nplugin for FireFox (found at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125). \n\nFitNesse is a collaborative testing tool that uses Wiki markup to create test \nscripts as web pages.  See http://fitnesse.org for more information.\n\nSyntax coloring supports:\n      * Numerous keywords in Slim and FitNesse are supported:\n         scenario, script, Query:, start, check, reject, show, Comment, comment, \n         !see, !include, !See, null, !define, !include\n      * Simple collapsible sections (with folding enabled)  !** *!, !**> *!\n      * Table cell delimiter \"|\"\n      * Cell contents\n      * Incomplete cell is error\n      * !style_(class) \n      * Strings in Quotes\n      * Scenario variables @parametername\n      * Symbols $symbolname\n      * Simple WikiWord support",

Unless you are \n   customizing the file, you should be OK to overwrite the files.\n  \n2) Syntax coloring support must be enabled. \n      \n      You can do this by adding :syntax enable to your _vimrc or .vimrc file.\n\n3) If you want automatic detection you will need to:\n\n      a) Check to see if you have a scripts.vim file already in place.
