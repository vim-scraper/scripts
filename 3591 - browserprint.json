  "description": "Usage\n=====\n\nAdds a new command, `:BrowserPrint`, which will send the contents of the current\nbuffer to a new browser window (or tab) in HTML, preserving the current font,\nformatting, and encoding.\n\nJust run `:BrowserPrint`, and watch the magic.\n\nWhy?\n====\n\nPrinting from MacVim opens a PDF in Preview, with monospace font and the\nencoding completely lost. Other GUI vims may have similar problems. This is a\nworkaround that relies on HTML and a decent web browser to preserve the\nformatting nicely.\n\nThe idea is to send it to the browser, then use the browser's built-in print\nfunctionality.\n\nLimitations\n===========\n- Requires Python support in Vim\n- Should work on Windows/Linux but not tested (yet!)\n- HTML content in the file will screw up the output as it isn't escaped\n",
