  "description": "There are a ton of existing abbreviation packages, but none were quite right.  This one provides some unique features:\n1. Doesn't expand the abbreviation in specified areas\n2. Doesn't expand the abbreviation unless a tab was pressed\n3. Placeholder will not compile in most languages\n4. Includes mappings to quickly select the next placeholder, accept defaults, or delete current placeholder.\n\nUsage:\n    Exports:\n        Eatchar() - removes any trailing spaces from abbreviations\n        ExpandIfSafe(from, to) - expands a:from to a:to if not in a specified block (strings, comments, character, doxygen, bibbrace currently)\n        Iab(ab, full) - define an abbreviation from a:ab to a:full which expands if safe\n        IabSelectNext - Finds the next placeholder and selects it\n        IabSelectDefault - Selects the default option\n    Maps:\n        ,, - Select the next placeholder\n        ,' - Select the default for the current placeholder\n        ,. - Delete the current placeholder\n    Example:\n        Iab('for', 'for(«$1:unsigned i = 0»; «$2:i < «$3»»; «$4:++i»)<CR>{<CR>«$5»<CR>}')\n        will define an abbreviation for for.  Now typing for<TAB> will expand to:\n        for(«$1:unsigned i = 0»; «$2:i < «$3»»; «$4:++i»)\n        {\n            «$5»\n        }\n        with «$1:unsigned i = 0» being selected.  Now typing ,' will change it to unsigned i = 0; and select the $2 branch (Note the numbers are not traversed in order, but instead are merely for marking placeholders.  In a future version this may change).  As it is in select mode typing any character will replace the placeholder.  If a placeholder is unwanted one can press ,., and to traverse use ,,.\n\n        Finally, note that abbreviations only expand if the last key was a tab, this ensures typing for<SPACE> will not expand.\n\nCustomization:\n    At the moment the only customization is via source modification.  The most likely lines to be modified are: 1) 89-96 to change the mappings, and 2) 44 to change what are the unsafe syntax and what character is used for expansion (currently this must be a non-control character).\n\nAlternatives:\n    snippetsEmu - vimscript #1318\n    snipMate - vimscript #2540\n    code-snippet - vimscript #2086\n    The first two do much more than this, and I had issues with both, e.g. they seemed to have troubles when inserting a snippet inside the middle of a snippet.  The latter is more like this, but differs in its behavior, namely they use the (very neat) trick of mapping a special key (<S-CR>) to execute the expansion, instead this script uses the (also hopefully neat) trick of checking the last character entered and only expanding when the last character is a tab.",
