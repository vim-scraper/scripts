  "description": "The TabIndent plugin allows you use the <Tab> key in Insert mode to indent the current line, as well as retain its usual task of inserting a real <Tab> character.  TabIndent exhibits a bit of intelligence by making sure that the current line is only indented if you're editing source code, by checking the 'cindent' and 'indentexpr' options.  Editing text files will never cause the <Tab> key to perform indentation.\n\nYou can also change the behaviour of when indentation is performed; some people prefer <Tab> to always perform indentation, and others may want to indent only if the cursor is at the start of the line.  TabIndent is designed to make every user work the way they want to.",
