  "description": "With Easy Vim [1], the code to perform a last position jump [2] can't restore a cursor position beyond EOL, because the jump will be executed in Normal mode [3].  The result in this case is a by-one error [4], so most people [5] won't find that annoying ...\n\nThe good news is that Vim seems to store a correct value in the viminfo file -- one solution is to restore the last position while in Insert mode, which is what the plugin does.\n\nEasy Vim actually is not required, the plugin will also work with a normal setup, or when you use  :startinsert  in the vimrc to merely start up in Insert mode.\n\nThe code is slightly more cautious than the original: the cursor won't be moved if something else already moved it, or if the buffer is special (help buffer, etc.).  Furthermore, to fix [6] a related case [7], the BufWinEnter autocommand is used instead of BufReadPost.\n\nThis lengthy description applies for a rather short piece of code.\n\n[1] :help 'insertmode' or :help -y\n[2] :h last-position-jump\n[3] explanation http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/msg/c571f994f211f8fe\n[4] the position is almost right, no issue for Bram: http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/msg/fbcffe406ff01b7f\n[5] especially of the few Easy vimmers\n[6] not sure if \"modify\" is the better word as what follows is probably not a bug\n[7] Cursor column not remembered ... http://groups.google.com/group/vim_dev/msg/b3512cecaab3e0b1\n",
  "install_details": "Drop the file into your plugin folder, restart Vim.\n\nFor newbies: this folder could be ~\\vimfiles\\plugin -- replace '~\\vimfiles' with the first entry of your 'runtimepath'.\n\nIf you are using the example vimrc :help vimrc_example.vim, you may have\n\nautocmd BufReadPost *\n  \\ if line(\"'\\\"\") > 1 && line(\"'\\\"\") <= line(\"$\") |\n  \\  exe \"normal! g`\\\"\" |\n  \\ endif\n\nin your vimrc Â– make sure to remove this old code.",
