  "description": "This colorscheme combines some of the ideas from the colorschemes darkzen vimscript #1402 and understated vimscript #1405.  It colors comments in a dark grey so that they don't distract you from seeing the code, but they are there if you need them. It should look similar in both console and Gui.  It looks really good for Python and Javascript, and hopefully will look good for other languages.",
