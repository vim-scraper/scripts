  "description": "vikitasks is a distributed todo lists manager. It provides a quick \noverview of priority/task lists maintained in several viki files. \nDepending on your settings, you can quickly search all \"homepages\" \nof intervikis or search only project-specific files. Buffers \ncontaining task lists are added to the list of vikitasks. There is \nalso an option to view a list of current tasks on startup.\n\n\nUsage:\n    :VikiTasks[!] [CONSTRAINT] [PATTERN] [FILE_PATTERNS]\n\n\nFeatures:\n    - Collect tasks from viki's priority lists (see |viki-tasks|)\n    - Sort those tasks\n    - Browse tasks with a given date\n    - Optionally browse all tasks (incl. those without a date)\n\n\nLet's say you have the files:\n\nfoo.txt: >\n    * Foo\n        #A 2009-12-13 Do this\n        #C 2009-12-20 :call @Anna What was it she wanted to tell me?\n        #A Whatever\n\nbar.txt: >\n    * Bar\n        #C 2009-12-24 :call @Bernie Wish him good luck\n        #D 2009-11-01 Do that\n\nLet's assume you have added both files to |g:vikitasks#files|. Switch to \nthe buffer foo.txt and call >\n\n    :VikiTasks!\n\nand you get the following list: >\n\n    Bar.txt|2| #D 2009-11-01 Do that\n    Foo.txt|2| #A 2009-12-13 Do this\n    Foo.txt|3| #C 2009-12-20 Call @Anna\n    Bar.txt|3| #C 2009-12-24 Wish @Bernie good luck\n\nIf you do/had done this on the 15 December 2009, the third line would be \nhighlighted, i.e. the entries above the cursor refer to passed/missed \nevents. If you had called :VikiTasks! (behold the bang), then the \n\"Whatever\" entry would have been included in the list too.\n\nIf you had called >\n    \n    :VikiTasks current\n\nonly the first two items would be listed.\n\nThis week's tasks (i.e. the tasks that should be accomplished today or \nwithin the following six days) could be listed with >\n    \n    :VikiTasks 6\n",
