It is intended to be used in addition to the default ftplugin for plaintex, which I also maintain.\n\nThe compiler plugin enables you to run tex (or pdftex) on your file with\n  :make\nand then correct errors using quickfix mode.\n\nThe filetype plugin maps \" (double quote mark) to insert `` (open quotes) at the start of a quotation, then '' (close quotes) at the end.  It also maps <C-B> to insert \"{\\bf }\" and <C-T> to insert \"{\\it \\/}\".  Both of these keys work in Normal, Insert, and Visual modes.",

From within vim, use\n  :helptags ~/.vim/doc\n(or whatever other directory you use) to install the help file.\n\nConfiguration:  There is a section of the ftplugin file that you can edit to change the key mappings and the menu location.  If you have already edited this section, then write it out to a separate file, plaintex.vimrc, in the ftplugin directory before you install a new version.",
