  "description": "There are many fine plugins that use persistent windows to display useful\ninformation (e.g. TagList plugin) or to provide bookmark-like portal to\nother files and buffers (e.g. Project or Buffer explorers etc.). There is\none major drawback to using them: you have to sacrifice precious screen real\nestate. One way to compensate is to put those auxillary windows in\n'side-pocket', and to open and close it when needed. So here comes SideBar.\n\nAs a stand-alone plugin it's pretty useless. It's really a framework that\nallows easy creation of SideBar-contained plugins. As an example I've\nincluded my very simplistic rewrite of excellent Project plugin by Aric\nBlumer. Note that it doesn't even try to manage its window. Just 'register'\nit in SideBar with following command (to learn more of ProjectJr, read its\ncomments):\n:SideBarAddCmd ProjectJr ~/main.prj\n\nNow you have mini-project in your side-pocket. Use :SideBarEnter or\n:SideBarEnterToggle to quickly enter/leave it. If you close its window\n(without destroying its buffer), or make it 'only', next invocation of one\nof those commands will bring SideBar back. Of course, it's best to map these\ncommands to some handy keys, e.g. <Tab>.\n\nYou can have as many projects/other buffers managed by SideBar as you wish.\nRegister these buffers with :SideBarAddCmd <any ex command> and switch\nbetween them with :SideBarCycle\n\nTo hack deep inside SideBar, another command is provided:\n:SideBarExec <any ex command> will execute <any ex command> in SideBar\ncontext without buffer registration. Note that you can use 's:' prefix to\ncall plugin-local functions and modify its variables, so proceed with\ncaution. To call functions local to your script, use <SID> prefix as\nusual.\n",
