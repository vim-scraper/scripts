  "description": "Some vim user want to shell like emacs's eshell. But vim don't support shell, \nterminal interface in vim (at least  7.x version). \n\nIn this situation, I try some terminal patches or shell attached plugins. But everyone don't perfectly emulate native terminal or have much dependencies. So I use simple native terminal and filemanager open script for my various platforms. \n\n\n\nCommmands \n    :OpenTerminal              Open native terminal sw. \n    :OpenFilemanager        Open native file manager. \n\n\n\nKey map recommendations (I'm using) \n   nnoremap <silent> <F9> :OpenTerminal<CR> \n   nnoremap <silent> <F10> :OpenFilemanager<CR><CR> \n\n\n\nTested platform \n * Mac  ~ Terminal.app,      finder\n  * MacVim\n * Windows 7 64bit, XP ~cmd.exe , explorer \n  * [portable] gVim\n * Gnome  ~ gnome-terminal,  nautilus\n  * gVim\n\nThis is very simple script.
