  "description": "To interact with Microsoft Word from VIM\nCurrently supports use of Word's Thesaurus and Speller\n\nCopyright (C) 2004 Suresh Govindachar  <initial><last name><at><yahoo>\n\nSystem Requirements:\n  \n   Windows (with MS Word)\n   VIM with embedded perl support\n   The perl module Win32::OLE (good way to get this is to have external perl)\n\nExports: \n \n   The following four commands are exported to the end-user:\n   \n      :WordThesaurus    [<cword>]\n      :WordSpell        [<cword>]\n      :WordAnagram      [<cword>]\n      :<range>WordCheckSpelling \n   \n   In regard to the first three commands:\n   \n    - Each command can be issued with no arguments or with one argument.\n      When no argument is provided, the <cword> (see :help cword) is \n      used as the argument.\n    - After execution, the \"result\" is appended below the current line.\n    - The \"result\" for the Thesaurus command is all \n      the synonyms and the antonyms.\n    - The \"result\" for the Spell command is all \n      the spelling suggestions.\n    - The \"result\" for the Anagram command is all \n      the anagrams of the given letters.\n   \n   Try the following:\n   \n      :WordThesaurus beautiful\n      :WordAnagram   abt\n      :WordSpell     helo\n      :WordSpell     b?t*\n   \n   In regard to the fourth command (:<range>WordCheckSpelling):\n      \n    - The default range is the whole buffer -- in order for\n      quickfix commands to work, there has to be a file \n      associated with the buffer.\n   \n    - Results are:\n   \n      - highlighting as Error each misspelled word in the range\n        (the filetype is set to nothing so that the only colored\n        stuff are the misspelled words)\n   \n      - ability to use the quickfix commands (:cfirst, :cn, etc) to \n        visit each misspelled word and to look at suggestions on spelling it.\n   \n      - Sub commands (of the :<range>WordCheckSpelling command):\n   \n           :WordShowMisspelled\n                Highlights misspelled words (there won't be any other highlighting)                 \n           :WordHideMisspelled\n                Restores highlighting based on filetype \n           The next five commands extend the corresponding quickfix \n                commands (:cfirst, :clast, :cc, :cn, :cp) by\n                loading the search register with the appropriate \n                misspelled word\n                    :Wordfirst\n                    :Wordlast\n                    :Wordc\n                    :Wordn\n                    :Wordp\n   \n      - Optional (controlled by g:no_plugin_maps or g:no_word_maps) \n        normal-mode maps:\n           <Leader>ws :WordShowMisspelled<CR>\n           <Leader>wh :WordHideMisspelled<CR>\n           <Leader>wc :Wordc<CR>\n           <Leader>wn :Wordn<CR>\n           <Leader>wp :Wordp<CR>\n\nTested on:\n\n   Windows 98 with Word 97 (and Vim 6.3, ActiveState's perl 5.8).\n   Anagram and WildCard NOT supported by Microsoft in later versions of MSWord -- see\n   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;224722 !!!\n\nKnown issue:\n  \n   Sometimes Windows and/or Word is sluggish and things\n   time-out with a \"no service available\" or some such \n   error message -- when this happens, just reissue the command.\n\nAcknowledgment:                                                              \n\n   Although I conceived and developed this plugin, I\n   learnt how to interact with Microsoft Word for \n   accessing its Thesaurus and Spelling from: \n\n    - Chad DeMeyer   (microsoft.public.word.word97vba)\n    - Steven Manross (perl-win32-users@listserv.ActiveState.com)\n    - Greg Chapman   (perl-win32-users@listserv.ActiveState.com)\n    - http://www.perlmonks.com/index.pl?node_id=119006\n\nDisclaimer:                                                                 \n\n   The material provided here is provided as-is without any warranty --\n   without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a\n   particular purpose.
