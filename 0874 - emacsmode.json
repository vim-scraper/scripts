I don't use Emacs, but a lot of source files have the lines.\n\nI tested this out by using it on the Mozilla code base, so the cases that are\nhandled are what appear there.  If there are other options that you find in\nother Emacs mode lines, send me an email so that I can get them added.\n",
  "install_details": "o install, simply copy emacsmode.vim an emacsmode.pl to your ~/.vim/plugin/\ndirectory.  If you have a perl enabled Vim, you can omit the emacsmode.pl\nscript, since it won't ever be called.\n\nIf you install into the perl runtime directory (i.e. /usr/share/vim,) and you\ndon't have a perl enabled Vim, you'll have to change one line in emacsmode.vim\nto point to the place where emacsmode.pl is installed.\n",
