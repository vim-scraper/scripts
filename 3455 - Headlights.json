It shows you the plugins you have installed, and reveals their associated commands, mappings, and script files.\n\nHeadlights works by scraping Vim's internal commands and using Python to generate the fancy menus. (Tip: you need a version of Vim compiled with Python support.)\n\nhttps://github.com/mbadran/headlights",
