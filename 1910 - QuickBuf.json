  "description": "QuickBuf\nVim plugin helps navigate and manipulate buffers\nMaintainer: palnart <palnart@gmail.com>\n\nBrief description:\nWhile making the task of browsing and manipulating buffers visual and simple, QuickBuf also offers advanced abilities of dealing with buffers (ex: \"unlisted\" mode). It's unique among several other buffer managers for creating no dedicated buffer and defining no auto command, thus minimize its interference.\n\nGive it a try and you may find it all you need to work with Vim's buffers!\nAny bugs or suggestions, please mail to: palnart@gmail.com\n\nUsage:\n+ Press the assigned hotkey to activate QuickBuf (default <F4>). It brings out a list of buffers that you can browse and give commands on! Some indicators in the list:\n\t- * : the buffer being opened in the active window\n\t- = : a buffer being opened in a window, but not active\n\t- [+] : modifed buffer\n+ Use k/j or <Up>/<Down> keys to select the buffer.\n+ Press a key to give a command to the currently selected buffer\n\t- d : delete buffer\n\t- w : wipe out buffer\n\t- s : open buffer in a new horizontally split window\n\t- u : open buffer\n\t- <enter> : open buffer and leave QuickBuf; if the\tbuffer is already opened in a window, switch to that window.\n+ d, w, and <enter> operations may fail (ex: delete a modified buffer), QuickBuf will inform you so that you can force them by preceding the above characters with an exclamation mark ('!'). Ex: !d, !w, !<enter>\n+ Instead of moving the selection bar around to select a buffer, you can use a number to specify a buffer. For example: '2d' will delete the second buffer in the list. Try '3<enter>', '1w', '1!w'\n+ Use 'l' key to toggle between LISTED and UNLISTED mode. Which mode QuickBuf enter first depends on the active buffer. While in UNLISTED mode, 'unlisted' buffers (the buffers you have deleted) are showed. Also:\n\t- [+] indicates a loaded buffer\n\t- 'd' command makes the selected buffer 'listed' again\n+ Press <esc> key to leave QuickBuf",

Default, key \"<F4>\" is used.\n\tWhenever you change g:qb_hotkey, :so qbuf.vim again to update hotkey.",
