  "description": "Spectro is a colorful scheme with a dark background. The colors are defined in the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) colorspace.\nThe main interest over the RGB colorspace, is that it's easy to change the overall brightness of the scheme in order to adapt to different screens. \nThe Saturation and Lightness are defined globally with g:spectro_saturation and g:spectro_lightness, which shall be set between 0 and 255.\n\nYou can see what it looks like here : \"http://pierreantoine.lacaze.free.fr/linux/config/\n\nNote that there is no support for terms yet.",
