It takes one (optional) argument.  If it is supplied, it is  \ntreated as a pattern, and only buffers matching that pattern will be          \ndisplayed.                                                                    \n                                                                              \nLocation lists are a feature of Vim 7 and up.  Please see :he location-list if\nyou are curious.                                                              \n\nA blog post with more information and a video demo are at http://blog.coryechols.net/2009/03/vim-script-buffer-select-in-window.html",
