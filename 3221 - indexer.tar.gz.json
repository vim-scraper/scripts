  "description": "PLEASE NOTE that in version 1.3 default name of project settings directory has been changed from \".vim\" to \".vimprj\" to avoid conflicts with standard ~/.vim directory. If you are using this feature and your project settings dir is \".vim\", please rename it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can use this plugin to automatically index your project files using ctags. This can be very useful when it's used together with plugins omnicppcomplete (for c, c++ development), code_complete.vim and other plugins that using tags.  You also will be able to jump from function call to its definition just by pressing Ctrl-] or g]\n\nThis plugin can work as add-on for project.tar.gz plugin ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=69 ). Indexer reads project file, parses it and builds tags for all files in project. But it also works fine without project.tar.gz.\n\n\nActually, if you are using project.tar.gz plugin and your projects file is default (~/.vimprojects), then setting Indexer up is very easily: you can just copy indexer.vim to your plugins directory, start Vim and open any file from your project.  The indexer plugin will detect that opened file is a file from project and automatically start ctags for each file in this project.  It also set &path and &tags options for Vim.\n\nIf you are using project.tar.gz, but you have another projects file, you should set option g:indexer_projectsSettingsFilename in your vimrc.\n\nIf you don't use project.tar.gz then you can use \".indexer_files\" to define projects and files to index.  Default location of this file is \"~/.indexer_files\". You can change it by modifying variable g:indexer_indexerListFilename\n\nSyntax of this file is simple, propably the best way to explain it is to show an example:\n--------------------- example ~/.indexer_files -----------------------\n[CoolProject] \n \n/home/user/myproject/src/*.c \n/home/user/myproject/src/*.h \n/home/user/myproject/inc/*.h \n \n[AnotherProject] \n \n/home/user/myproject2**/*.c \n/home/user/myproject2**/*.h \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have many projects and you are lazy to put every project in\nthis file, you can put in your ~/.indexer_files something like this:\n\n--------------------- example ~/.indexer_files -----------------------\n[PROJECTS_PARENT filter=\"*.c *.h *.cpp\"]\n~/workspace\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe keyword is PROJECTS_PARENT.\nIn this way, every directory in ~/workspace will be interpreted as separate\nproject, and you can open any file from any project in ~/workspace, and the \nwhole proper project will be indexed.\n\n\nAnd, finally, it can autodetect project root. So, you can move your project to another place in filesystem, and all files will be indexed anyway.  More detailed help see in options, variable \"g:indexer_lookForProjectDir\".\n\nYou need ctags to be installed to make this plugin work. http://ctags.sourceforge.net/\n\nI have tested it both on Linux and Windows, in Vim 7.3\nIf you have any troubles using this plugin, please email me.\n",
