  "description": "Functionality in this script has been superseded by Multi-Replace.\nRefer to http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2938\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis script provides two replacement capabilities, both involving a second buffer.\n\n[=] OVERVIEW\n\n1. DICTIONARY REPLACE\n=====================\nReplace words according to a tab-separated list of word-pairs.\nWords on the left of the tab are the words to search for, \nwords on the right are the corresponding replacements.\n\nExample:\n  1. %s\n  2. %s\n  3. %b\n  [BEFORE]===============\n  1. stars\n  2. stars\n  3. breasts\n  [AFTER]================\n\nTypical use: \n- Variable substitution on a template.\n- Performing a join on two lists\n- Reording lines given orderd list of keys\n\n2. LIST REPLACE\n===============\nReplace matches using text from line matching\norder of appearance.\n\nExample:\n  1. %f are good for your body.\n  2. %v are bad for your body.\n  3. %f are good for your body.\n  4. %v are bad for your body.\n  5. %f are good for your body.\n  6. %v are bad for your body.\n  [BEFORE]===============\n  1. apples are good for your body.\n  2. %v are bad for your body.\n  3. vegetables are good for your body.\n  4. %v are bad for your body.\n  5. vitamins are good for your body.\n  6. %v are bad for your body.\n  [AFTER]================\n\nTypical use: \n- Repeating blocks of code with different identtifiers\n- Intersparsing lines from a file with lines from another file\n\n[=] USAGE\n\n1. DICTIONARY REPLACE\n=====================\n\nLet's say we have some text.\n  =====================\n  your eyes are like stars kissing the breasts of the galaxies.\n  your %e are like %s kissing the %b of the galaxies.\n  1. %s\n  2. %s\n  3. %b\n  4. %s\n  5. %b\n  6. %e\n  7. %e\n  [TEXT]================\n\nIn a separate buffer, prepare a list of tab-separated words. Make sure\nthat the pairs are sperated by tabs and not space characters!\n  =====================\n  breasts\tstars\n  eyes\tbreasts\n  stars\teyes\n  %s\tstars\n  %b\tbreasts\n  %e\teyes\n  [DICT]================\n\nIn the alternate buffer, runthe command \",dict\" \n(comma-dict) standing for \"dictionary\".\n  ,dict\n\nNow go back to our text buffer, and do a selection to match all words. Only words matching current search pattern are replaced.\n  /\\S\\+\n\nRun the command \",rict\" (comma-rict) standing for \"replace dictionary\".\n  =====================\n  your breasts are like eyes kissing the stars of the galaxies.\n  your eyes are like stars kissing the breasts of the galaxies.\n  1. stars\n  2. stars\n  3. breasts\n  4. stars\n  5. breasts\n  6. eyes\n  7. eyes\n  [TEXT]=[+]=============\n\nLimitation: \nReplacements are only done on words matching \nthe current search pattern. This is not a true\nmulti-replace solution, but more efficient.\n\n2. List Replace\n===============\n\nLet's say we have some text.\n  =====================\n  1. %f are good for your body.\n  2. %v are bad for your body.\n  3. %f are good for your body.\n  4. %v are bad for your body.\n  5. %f are good for your body.\n  6. %v are bad for your body.\n  [TEXT]================\n\nIn a separate buffer, the list for replacement.\nMake sure there are enough rows to match target\ntext!\n  =====================\n  apples\n  vegetables\n  vitamins\n  [DICT]================\n\nIn the alternate buffer, runthe command \",list\" \n(comma-list) standing for \"list\".\n  ,list\n\nNow go back to our text buffer, and do a selection\nto match %f which we want to replace.\n  /%f\n\nRun the command \",rist\" (comma-rist) standing for \"replace list\".\n  =====================\n  1. apples are good for your body.\n  2. %v are bad for your body.\n  3. vegetables are good for your body.\n  4. %v are bad for your body.\n  5. vitamins are good for your body.\n  6. %v are bad for your body.\n  [TEXT]=[+]=============\n\nLimitation: \nMatches on the same line are replaced with the same string. There's no option to choose to replace with the next string right now.",
