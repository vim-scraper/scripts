The only changes from Farrington's scheme is that I did away with the 'dark maroon' guibg and added Pmenu colors.\n\nScreenshots here => \"http://robrobbins.info/?page_id=2&quot;",

If you have any term prefs in your .vimrc (like I had t_co=256) comment them out if you plan to launch from a terminal window or the colors may be incorrect (I notice this on my linux box. I'm going to update with terminal compat modes soon - rob)",
