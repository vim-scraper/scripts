  "description": "There are a fair number of ispell/aspell based spelling checkers out there -- but engspchk isn't one of them.  The engspchk source uses Vim's native syntax highlighting to catch spelling errors, so you get quick on-the-fly spellchecking!  An optional external program, agrep, may be used to suggest alternative spellings. With the optional <engspchk.rare> dictionary, <engspchk.vim> now provides over 186730 words (over 189000 when including proper names)!\n\nEngspchk flags rare/unusual words and allows the user to specify his/her preferred dialect (let g:spchkdialect=\"usa\", \"uk\", or \"can\").  Click-N-Fix by enabling the mouse (example: :set mouse=n) and a leftmouse click in the document will advance the cursor to the next spelling error; a leftmouse click in the alternative spellings window will substitute the selected word for the misspelled word.  A rightmouse click will do that substitute for all such misspellings in your file.\n\nEngspchk is no longer English-only: it supports multiple languages.  You can tell it what language (dictionary) to use by either renaming it (ex.  engspchk.vim -> frspchk.vim for French) or by specifying the variable g:spchklang (ex. let g:spchklang=\"ger\" for German).  See http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#vimlinks_scripts for some dictionaries: currently, that includes Dutch, French, Galician, German, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Yiddish.\n\nThe engspchk s/w includes maps for jumping to the next and preceding spelling errors, alternative spellings, and for saving words either permanently in a custom dictionary or just for the current session.\n\nEngspchk's dictionaries are optional.  SpellChecker, for example, claims to load faster because it doesn't handle unusual words.  Merely deleting <CVIMSYN/engspchk.rare> will speed up loading (which is pretty fast anyway).  Both support flagging dialect-sensitive words, but only Engspchk has Click-N-Fix and rare word support.  Telling the difference between \"or the\" and \"ort he\" is easy -- the \"ort\" will show up with RareWord highlighting (default: black on cyan).\n\nTo begin checking your spelling with engspchk, and assuming that <engspchk.vim> has been put into your .vim/plugin directory, simply start up engspchk by applying the English Check map:\n\n    \\ec\n\nand your spelling errors will show up highlighted in white-on-red.  Alternatively, if you're using gvim, select DrChip:Load Spelling Checker from the menu.\n\nIf you want to change languages, engspchk provides a lot of ways to help you:\n\n  * set g:spchklang appropriately and \\ec will load that language's dictionary.  The backslash is actually using <mapleader>, so you can customize the backslash to whatever you want.\n  * you may embed a modeline at the beginning or at the end of the file:  ex. spchk: lang=nl.\n  * using gvim, there's a \"Load AltLang Spelling Checker\" submenu for choosing whatever language(s) for which you have dictionaries!\n  * engspchk looks over your dictionaries and constructs simple commands: :Engspchk  :Frspchk  :Gerspchk  :Nlspchk  :Spanspchk  etc,\n\nIt will work with some cooperating syntax files to check out spelling in comments, including:\n\namiga, bib, c, cpp, csh, d, dcl, dtml, elmfilt, exports, fortran, html, java, lex, lisp, mail, maple, sh, sm, smarty, tcsh, tex, vim, and xmath\n\nIf your favorite computer language isn't on that list, perhaps you can talk that language's maintainer into making it engspchk compatible.\n\nMore Features:\n\nVersion 42-45:\n  click'n'fix button support improved: with a click, one can re-try alternates, accept misspellings (skip by them), and apply corrected spelling to entire document.  (see :he engspchk-clicknfix)\n\n  The alternative spellings window can now be either on the bottom or on the right hand side. (see :he engspchk-variables)\n\n  PreProc highlighting used to emphasize word selected for alternate spellings\n\n  A number of bug fixes -- see   :help |engspchk-history| (after downloading, of course!)\n\nVersion 41:\n    Engspchk can be loaded into multiple windows concurrently; one can force spell checking of non-highlighted text with the g:spchknonhl variable; RareWord and Dialect added to the @Spell cluster; and the 'hidden' option is set to allow preserve engspchk highlighting (\\ee will restore the user's hidden setting).\n\nVersion 40:\n    *@Spell cluster utilized.\n    *Allow two or more sequential capitalized\n     letters to be ignored (English only, acronym support).\n    *Yura Kloubakov's inclusion of the user's\n     mapleader in the DrChip menu and removal\n     of \\ec after use\n    *Entered dozens of city names into <engspchk.proper>\n\nVersion 34:\n    The latest engspchk includes:\n    differentiating between common, dialect, and rare words, saving/restoring gdefault option maps to make a word a temporary/permanent BadWord\n    Click-N-Fix\n\nVersion 32:\n    English dialects supported (usa can uk); bug fixes (ending engspchk, alternatives, etc)\n\n\nVersion 30:\n    Engspchk, the native Vim spelling checker, is better than ever!\n\n    * Click'n'Fix:\n      - leftmouse to move to the next error\n      - leftmouse to select correctly spelled word\n      - rightmouse to fix all instances of\n        misspelled word\n      Makes spell-checking a document Fast and Easy!\n\n    * New maps:\n      - \\eS, \\eT to take a word under the cursor\n        out of the user dictionary (permanently\n        or just this session)\n      - \\ee to end engspchk; restores prior maps\n        and restores normal highlighting\n      - <tab> in alternative-word window does\n        a global replace of the misspelled word\n        with the user-selected correctly spelled\n        word\n\n    * optional auto-jump to next spelling error\n      for \\es, \\et, and \\ea.\n    * will signal if syntax highlighting is off.\n    * Plus a bugfix for Mac users\n\n    Plus engspchk supports a non-English languages,\n    checks for spelling inside comments for C, C++,\n    Fortran, DCL (VMS), csh/sh/ksh/bash, tex, and\n    more.\n\nVersion 27: New features for the Vim-based spelling checker!\n\n    * Maps to remove words from the user dictionary\n      (\\eT, \\eS).\n\n    * If g:spchk_autonext exists, then \\et, \\es, and\n      \\ea (if a word is selected) will automatically\n      do a \\en jump to the next spelling error.\n\n    * \\en and \\ep will now examine words inside folds,\n      opening the fold as necessary to display spelling\n      errors.\n\nVersion 23:\n    Can handle English, French, German, Spanish, Dutch,\n    Hungarian -- just set up a dictionary and set a\n    g:spchklang variable!  Native vim code, no external\n    programs necessary\n\nVersion 19:\n    Now contains: engspchk.vim engspchk.dict\n    engspchk.wb engspchk.txt Over 187192 words!\n    non-English support menus, documentation, English\n    punctuation checking (g:spchkpunc)\n\n\nAlternative Spelling Checkers\n    SpellChecker - Ajit Thakkar                   - syntax     - vimscript#499\n    vimspell          - Mathieu Clabaut            - [ia]spell   - vimscript#465\n    spellcheck      - Matthias Veit                 - ispell       - vimscript#131\n    spell                - Yegappan Lakshmanan - spell        - vimscript#232\n    vim-spell         - Luc Hermite                    - [ia]spell  - vimscript#135\n\n\nThank you for ranking engspchk!\n\n(alpha/beta version available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#ENGSPCHK)\n",
