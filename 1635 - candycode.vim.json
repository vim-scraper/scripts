  "description": "This is my personal colorscheme, which I've been carefully tweaking over the past couple years.  It uses a (nearly) black background contrasted with bright pastel colors, which I think are easy to read and rather purty, too.  I don't know of any colorschemes that are too similar, but then again I've only seen a fraction of the huge number that are out there.\n\nHTML \"screenshot\": http://goflyapig.googlepages.com/candycodesample.html\nPNG screenshot: http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/9297/screenshotcandycodevimvimcolorsgvim1ki2.png\n\nOptimized for the GUI version, but color terminal settings are included, too.",
