  "description": "This is a bunch of colors that I thought were visually appealing and looked good together.  The background is light shades of gray, and the text is all dark colors.\n\nTo be honest, I don't do a lot of testing with syntax files that I don't use often.  Therefore, languages that I don't use may not look too great.  If this happens, please e-mail me and I'll fix the problem ASAP :-)\n\nNote that this color scheme only works in GUI mode (i.e., gvim and not \"terminal vim\").\n\nFor a screenshot, click the \"Vim wiki\" link above.",
