  "description": "(22/09/07 This should be soon added to the official ocaml ftplugin)\n\nOcaml support for annot file is already implemented in the official Ocaml ftplugin and in ocaml.annot.pl (script_id=1197).\n\nBut this script adds the following:\n\n   - no need for python support (neither perl or anything else : only vim code inside)\n     + plus: more portable\n     + minus: no more lazy parsing, it looks very fast however\n     \n   - ocamlbuild support, ie.\n     + the plugin finds the _build directory and looks for the \n       corresponding file inside;\n     + if the user decides to change the name of the _build directory thanks\n       to the '-build-dir' option of ocamlbuild, the plugin will manage to find it out;\n     + if ocamlbuild is not used, the usual behaviour holds; ie. the .annot\n       file should be in the same directory as the source file;\n     + for vim plugin programmers:\n       the variable 'b:_build_dir' contains the inferred path to the build \n       directory, even if this one is not named '_build'.\n\n Bonus:\n   - latin1 accents are handled\n   - lists are handled, even on multiple lines, you don't need the visual mode\n     (the cursor must be on the first bracket)\n   - parenthesized expressions, arrays, and structures (ie. '(...)', '[|...|]',\n     and '{...}') are handled the same way\n\nUsage:\n   - press <LocalLeader>t to display the type of expression under cursor\n   - don't forget to compile with -dtypes option (or -cflags -dtypes if you're using ocamlbuild)\n\n\n",
