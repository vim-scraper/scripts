  "description": "If we call \":Acpp\" when editing \"/path/to/file/src/ae/cmd/File.cpp\", VIM opens complementary \"/path/to/file/include/ae/cmd/File.h\" file, and vice versa. That is, it searches for the last occurrence of \"/src/\" or \"/include/\" and changes this along with the file extension (h to cpp, and cpp to h).\nNOTE: This works with ONLY single occurrence of \"/src/\" or \"/include/\"\nIf current full path doesn't contain \"/src/\" or \"/include/\" and/or does not end with \"h\" or \"cpp\" then \"Acpp\" opens a file named \"0\"\n\nIt does not strictly depend on Vim 7, it's just the version I have, the script should work fine with previous versions too.",
  "install_details": "I simply added the following line into my ~/.vimrc file:\nsource ~/acpp.vim\nYou can also place it to /usr/share/vim/vim71/plugin directory (substitute vim71 with your vimVERSION)",
