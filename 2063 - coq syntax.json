I answered that yes and that I had started it. The plugin is usable but not Â“publishable\" :) However I now have many other things to do and am not using Coq at that time. So if I publish such a thing some day it may be in quite a long time. Apologies.",

Create the file ~/.vim/ftdetect/coq.vim and put the following line inside:\n\n  au BufRead,BufNewFile *.v   set filetype=coq\n\n(Notice that *.v files are also used for verilog sources. This will make vim recognize *.v files as coq ones. VERILOG FILES WON'T BE RECOGNIZED ANYMORE.)\n",

      "release_notes": "- Changed the colours. It should now be more uniform and more readable. Tell me if you prefer the way it was before. \n- Improved the way things are coloured : in previous versions, the plugin often had to wait until you finish the current sentence before colouring it. Quite inconvenient. Now, it will colour things as you type them (for almost all constructions). Colouring is also more robust."
