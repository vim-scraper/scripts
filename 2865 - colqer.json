  "description": "This script allows to quicky switch to Colemak   from a Qwerty keyboard, which is usefull if you are learning Colemak or want to come back to the Qwerty keybinding from a Colemaek keyboard.\n \nThis is a an approximation of the langmap feature, but which works even if your vim version has been compiled with the langmap feature.\n\nDepending of your keyboard layout, this script will either map the qwerty key into Colemak key in insert mode\nor map the Colemak key to qwerty in command mode.\nSo whatever your keyboard is Qwerty or Colemak, you could type text in Colemak and command in Qwerty.\n\nThis script is disabled by default, to activate it, type \\; (on a Qwerty keyboard) or \\o )on a Colemak one).\nMapping:\n<Leader>; toggle script on Qwerty keyboard\n<Leader>o toggle script activation on a Colemak keyboard\n(if you don't know wthat Leader is, it would probably be  \"\\\" in your case, so the mapping are \\; and \\o)\n\nWarning, this script might interfere with your personal mapping, in that case the easiest way to do it is to delete or modify  the problematic mapping/unmapping  lines in the script.",
