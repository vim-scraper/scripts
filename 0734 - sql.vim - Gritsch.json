It should do highlighting of all documented Oracle 9iR2  SQL commands/keywords and SQL+ commands. \nPL/SQL blocks within a SQL file will be marked as one uniform block without further highlighting. \nI tried to stick to the Oracle Documentation concerning keywords and commands as far as possible, so not everything you would expect to be a keyword is one (e.g. DUAL).\n",
