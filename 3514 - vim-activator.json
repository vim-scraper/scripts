  "description": "There's a script that comes with vim distribution for editing with existing\nvim in Windows.  However, this feature doesn't work in Linux xterm\nenvironment.  There's a beast called Vim Shell by Thomas Wana, but it's not\nofficially endorsed by vim.  When you exit vim to shell by pressing <ctrl-z>\nwhich suspends the vim, this nifty little gadget allows you edit subsequent\nfiles by reusing the existing vim.  It's kind of emulates a vim shell from the\nview point of a normal user.  This tool requires client-server option to be\nenabled in vim.",
  "install_details": "1.  Put .bash_profile into your home directory.  If there's already existing\none, then you can rename the untar file to a different name, and source\nit from the existing .bash_profile.\n\n2.  Change the path to vimactivator in .bash_profile line 2 according your\ncurrent setting.",
