  "description": "  This colorscheme implements colors that let Vim look just a little like Emacs.\n  It is not perfect in several respects: For one Emacs has very different categories for its syntax highlighting. Many more, often, which tends to let your screen light up like a christmas tree sometimes. I can't reproduce that without changing the syntax files, and I don't want that. The scheme tries to look like Emacs, but I only really checked for C++. The most important thing is the color of comments, and these are right. The other aspect is the suitability of the script for terminal based Vims - I didn't check, it's for GVim.\n",
  "install_details": "  You can just source the script whenever you want. That way it even works in older Vims, but with warnings - ignore them.\n  If you put it in a color directory, for instance .vim/colors, the color scheme will pop up in the menu, where you can choose it, or you can use  the \":colorscheme emacs\" command.",
