  "description": "Currently one may have a single syntax file per filetype in the .vim/after/syntax directory.  Such files are loaded after the main syntax handling file, and are used to provide additional customized syntax highlighting.  But, what if you want two or more such files for some filetype?  <aftersyntax.vim> solves just that problem...\n\nFor example, consider the C language and Andreechtchev Eugeni's opengl.vim extension for recognizing OpenGL functions and constants (vimscript#752) plus my blockhl.vim (vimscript#104) for highlighting leading tabs based on {} depth:\n\n\tExample:\n\t1. cd .vim/after/syntax\n\t2. mkdir c\n\t3. mv (wherever)/aftersyntax.vim c.vim\n\t4. mv opengl.vim  c\n\t5. mv blockhl.vim c\n\nEvery time a C file is opened, both opengl.vim and blockhl.vim are sourced to provide their extra highlighting.\n",
  "install_details": "(see the example above)\n1. cd .vim/after/syntax\n2. mkdir [the filetype you want multiple-file support for]\n3. mv or cp (ren or copy) aftersyntax.vim [new filetype].vim\n4. put whatever additional syntax highlighting files you wish in the\n   .vim/after/syntax/[filetype]/\n   directory.   They'll all be sourced for that filetype.\n\nNote for non-Unix users:\n\n1. Type vim\n   :echo &rtp\n\n   This will give you your \"runtimepath\".  (see :help 'rtp')\n   You'll see something like\n\n   \t   somepath/vimfiles\n   \t   home:vimfiles\n   \t   somepath:vimfiles\n\n2. Under that directory, you may have such things as (I'll use\n   forward slashes (/) here as vim usually displays them, although\n   they may \"actually\" use backslashes (\\) or dev:[some.path.vimfiles],\n   etc)\n\n   .../after\n   .../after/syntax\n   .../doc\n   .../plugin\n\n   etc.  See :help 'rtp' for more...\n\n3. You may then rename/copy this script into the .../after/syntax\n   directory, make a subdirectory as for Unix, and put your syntax\n   files in it.\n",
