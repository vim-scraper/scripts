This script helps to load files from different places but with the right settings. I use \"ts=4, sw=4, ...\" in directories i use, and set it to \"ts=8, sw=8, ...\" in the root of the linux kernel directory. These configurations are stored in a file called .lvimrc, subdirectories inherit the settings from their parent unless the subdirectory itself doesnot have a .lvimrc file.\n",
