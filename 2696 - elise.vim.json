  "install_details": "Just put it into your  ~/.vim/colors and try it with:\n    :color elise\nAfter you try this colorscheme, you probably may want to use it every day.\nIf that is your case, then it is best to strip-off all useless comments\nand empty lines of the file. Executing these commands will do that:\n\n  * Remove all leading comments and empty lines with:\n       :%g/\\(^$\\|^\\s\\+$\\)\\|\\(^\".*\\|^\\s\\+\".*\\)/d\n\n  * Remove all leading spaces and tabs with:\n       :%s/^\\s\\+//g",
