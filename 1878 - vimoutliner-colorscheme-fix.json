  "description": "If you're familiar with VimOutliner, at http://vimoutliner.org, you know it's a fantastic outlining tool that can easily become your default way to use Vim. The one major annoyance I've found is that it ships with one or two colorschemes. \nUnlike most syntax files, the colors are hard-coded in, so if you try to use a different colorscheme, the syntax highlighting disappears.\n\nFortunately, there's an easy fix. This tiny package is simply an updated syntax file, in which I have linked the syntax groups to established Vim groups, like Normal, Comment, and so on. You can now open a VimOutliner file in any colorscheme you like. \n\nYoull still get some occasional weirdnesses (certain elements can default to invisible), in which case you can either change colorschemes, tweak the colorscheme itself, or tweak syntax/vo_base.vim. Anyhow, it usually works.\n\n(More info at http://www.billpowellisalive.com/2007/01/vimoutliner-and-a-tweak-to-use-colorschemes/)",

Note that THIS WILL OVERWRITE THE OLD SYNTAX FILE, e.g., ~/.vim/syntax/vo_base.vim, so back it up if you want it around. \n\nAlso, I've only tested this on a Linux machine. The actual file has a long name which includes its \nOf course, the next type you upgrade VimOutliner, this syntax fix will be wiped out. But Im posting this on the VimOutliner site; maybe this tweakll be in the next version. ",
