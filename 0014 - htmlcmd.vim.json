  "description": "This script handles a number of mundane tasks in HTML / XML.  It allows you to create a default HTML header (Alt+0),  to define headings <h1> .. <h6> (Alt+1.. Alt+6), to toggle bold, italic, underline, paragraphs & kbd commands.  It gives shortcuts for ordered/unordered lists and row definitions.  \n\nThe script has commands to insert horizontal rules, line-breaks, and a number of  special symbols (just email me to add your favourite).  \n\nIt has imap mappings that give you ampersands (&&), smart-quotes (single - &' and double &\"), <, > symbols,   and more.  It allow you to insert these and text descriptors or as numbers (for strict XML)\n\nYou can close the next open tag (alt-;) or close all open tags at that point (alt->).  \nNot you may need to remap these for other platforms.\n\n\nIf you have defined 'htmlcmd_AUTOCLOSE' then there is some reasonably intrusive code that will close open tags: \ntry typing this\n<p>Testing<b>bold</p>\n\nThis should automatically close the <b>\n\nYou can also generate a quick Table Of Contents for your document based on <H1>..<H6> headings.  There is a menu item to insert it.. and any options you give \nare remembered for when you re-generate the TOC. \n\nGenerateTOC( [<headingtypes>| * ]) \n:GenTOC [<headingtypes>| * ]\n\nThe optional argument is a string of types for each indent level. Eg. \" 1ai.\" would mean level 1 is default (bullet), level 2 is a numbered list, level 3 has letters and level three has roman numerals. \nIt uses references where it can find them, and generates new ones where it can't.\nThe arguments supplied are remembered so the TOC can be regenerated without resuplying them.\nIf * is supplied as an argument, the script prompts for arguments - showing what the current values are.\n\nWhen used with buffermenu.vim - Menus (for TOC generation) are local to the buffer.\n",
