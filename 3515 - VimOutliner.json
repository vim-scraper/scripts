Keystrokes are quick and easy, especially for someone knowing the Vim editor. The mouse is completely unnecessary (but is supported to the extent that Vim supports the mouse). Many of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma because that&#039s very quick to type.\n\nMany of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma \",,\" because that's very quick to type. All VimOutliner files have the \".otl\" extension. For an overview of the VimOutliner commands you can type \":h vo_cheatsheet\" when you have opened an otl file. For help on VimOutliner type \":h vo\"\n\n* Usage\n\nVimOutliner has been reported to help with the following tasks:\n  - Project managment.\n  - Password wallet => http://img71.imageshack.us/my.php?image=vimpasswordwalletpngvi4.png\n  - To-do lists.\n  - Account and cash book.\n  - &#039Plot device&#039 for writing novels.\n  - Inventory control.\n  - Hierarchical database.\n  - Web site managment.\n\n* Characteristics\n\n  - Fast.\n  - Extensible through plugins.\n  - Many post-processing scripts allow exporting to multiple formats.\n  - Extensive documentation.",
