  "description": "Since writing this, I've discovered heaps about short names.  There are many caveats, but the biggest 3 are:\n1) After the first 4 similar names, windows uses a hash algorithm to work out the 3rd-6th letters of the name.\n2) Samba uses a different hash algorithm to work out the short name\n3) There is a Win32 API function call to set the short name of a file.\n\nThis script contains a function that works out only simple win32 8.3 short versions of a filename.  It will\nwork unless there are more than 4 files with the same name.\n\nI have since written a patch for Vim6.1 which will allow windows users acces to the short-filename via the api call... expect it soon.. (via fnamemodify and probably using the modifier :8 )\n\nNOTE: This is part of Vim 6.1 - \n     echo fnamemodify( 'c:\\vim\\plugins\\shortname.vim', ':8') \n\nEg\necho GetWin32ShortName('c:\\vim\\plugins\\shortname.vim')\n\nshould produce:  c:\\vim\\plugins\\shortn~1.vim\nor something like that.\n\n",
