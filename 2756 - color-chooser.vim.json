  "install_details": "requirements:\nThe script requires Python version>=2.5 with PyGTK module and GTK to run. It works best with gVim (on xterm Vim there is a bug: the window does not close after the color is selected -- it is usable but awkward).\n\nhow to install: \nCopy the file color-chooser.vim to your plugin directory (\"~/.vim/plugin\"). For the change to take effect, either restart Vim or source the script manually by the command \n:so ~/.vim/plugin/color-chooser.vim\n\nIf you want to install the script for all users, copy it to the main plugin directory of Vim - usually \"/usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/plugin\".\n\nAfter installation, the color selection window is launched by \n:call ColorChooser()\nMap it to a key, such as <F2>, this way:\n:map <F2> :call ColorChooser()<enter>\nThe map command is commented in the script file, you can simply uncomment it.\n\nSeveral options can be set by editing the \"script configuration\" section in the file -- they are described there.",
