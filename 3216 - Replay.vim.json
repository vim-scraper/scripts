  "description": "Feedback is welcome. Please rate this plugin, if you like it.\n\nThis is probably a little bit a silly plugin, but may be this is of use for someone.\n\nThis plugin does not cope with recording and replaying macros, rather it steps though your undo tree so you can see, \nwhat changes have been done, since starting editing.\n\nUse :StartRecording \"tag\" to start recording from the current change on and save it under the name \"tag\"\nUse :StopRecording \"tag\" to let the Recording for \"tag\" end at this change.\nUse :Replay \"tag\" to Replay your changes.\n\nYou can usually leave tagname out and Replay.vim will record your changes under the name \"Default\".\nSee :h Replay.txt to read the help\n\nThis Plugin is also available at github: http://github.com/chrisbra/Replay",
