  "description": "Rationale:\nThe terminal window manager Screen http://www.gnu.org/software/screen\noffers the capability to copy and paste between windows.\nIn principle you can just do \"C-a ]\" (default) to paste the current Screen buffer into a vim buffer.\nHowever this gives unexpected results when 'paste' is not set or in Vim's command-line.\nThis script provides convenience mappings and functions to get correct results.\nAs an additional feature the current Screen buffer is available\nin any Vim instance, even those /outside/ the current screen session.\nMany commands are autodetected and the behaviour adapts automatically [:help getcmdtype()].\n\nMaps:\nAssuming the default mapleader \"\\\" and screenpaste's default mappings you can type:\n\\p   in Normal mode to put Screen buffer after cursor\n\\P   in Normal mode to put Screen buffer before cursor\n\\gp in Normal mode to put Screen buffer after cursor and leave cursor after new text\n\\gP in Normal mode to put Screen buffer before cursor and leave cursor after new text\n\\p   in Visual mode to replace selection with Screen buffer\n\\gp in Visual mode to replace selection with Screen buffer and leave cursor after new text\n\\p   in Insert and Replace mode to insert Screen buffer\n\\p   in Command-line-mode to insert Screen buffer\n\nCommands:\n\n:ScreenYank [x]\nyanks Screen buffer [into register x]\n\n:[line]ScreenPut [x]\nputs Screen buffer after [line] (default: current line) using register [x]\n\n:[line]ScreenPut! [x]\nputs Screen buffer before [line] (default: current line) using register [x]\n\n:ScreenCmdlineConf  search | sub | noesc\ntells script how to convert Screen buffer in Command-line mode\nExamples as typed with default keybindings:\n:ScreenCmdlineConf search\n:s/\\p/repl/\n:ScreenCmdlineConf sub\n:s/pattern/\\p/\n\n:ScreenCmdlineInfo\nechoes info on current Command-line mode behaviour\n\n:ScreenSearch\nsets conversion of Screen buffer inserted in cmdline for search use\n\n:ScreenSub\nsets conversion of Screen buffer inserted in cmdline for substitution use\n\n:ScreenNoEsc\nsets end-of-line only conversion for Screen buffer insertion in cmdline\n\nVimrc Examples:\nChange mappings:\nNormal and Visual mode:\nmap  <Leader>P <Plug>ScreenpastePut\nNormal mode (put before cursor):\nnmap <Leader>I <Plug>ScreenpastePutBefore\nInsert and Command-line mode:\nmap! <F7> <Plug>ScreenpastePut\nChange cmdline behaviour setting at startup:\nlet g:screen_clmode = \"sub\"\nSpecify Screen executable (default: 'screen'):\nlet g:screen_executable = \"/usr/local/bin/screen\"\nSwitch register used for Screen buffer (default: '\"' for unnamed register):\nlet g:screen_register = \"s\"\nAutomatically select pasted text in Visual mode:\nlet g:screen_visualselect = 1\nWait longer for Screen to finish writing its exchange file:\nlet g:screen_wait = '500m'\n\nMercurial repository: http://www.blacktrash.org/hg/screenpaste",
