  "description": "This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack. Ack can be used as a replacement for 99% of the uses of grep. This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and shows the results in a split window.\n\nSearch recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current directory) for the {pattern}.\n\nFiles containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence. [Enter] on a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching line.\n\nWhere you would use :grep, :grepadd, :lgrep, and :lgrepadd, you can use :Ack, :AckAdd, :LAck, and :LAckAdd respectively.\n\nFor more information, and to check out the unstable, development version of the plugin, go here: http://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim/tree/master\n\nThis Vim plugin is derived (and by derived, I mean copied, essentially) from Antoine Imbert's blog post Ack and Vim Integration (http://blog.ant0ine.com/2007/03/ack_and_vim_integration.html) (in particular, the function at the bottom of the post).",
