An even quicker way to send a message\n  entirely from the vim command line.\n- Added the _vmf command. A quick way of sending a file entirely\n  from the vim command line.\n- Includes mailit.cpp - a simple test app you can use to test the\n  dll outside of vim. Could be used to send messages in a batch file.\n- Changed the _mmh command to _vmh (for vim mailer header) to be\n  more consistent with the other commands in the script.\n"
