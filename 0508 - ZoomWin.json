  "description": "Note: version 23 or later of ZoomWin requires vim 7.2 or later\n\nUsage:\n\n    Press <c-w>o : the current window zooms into a full screen\n    Press <c-w>o again: the previous set of windows is restored\n\nFeatures:\n\nThe idea is to make it easy to zoom into and out of a window.  ZoomWin supports normal windows, and it now also supports scratch-windows, no-name windows, and modified-buffer windows.\n\n * ZoomWin is a 7.2 plugin (as of v23)\n\n * Files are made hidden during zoom-in and restored upon zoom-out\n\n * All windows' file contents will be restored during zoomouts. \n\n * ZoomWin will clean up any temporary files it generates upon exit.\n \n * Session files are guaranteed to be unique to each vim session, so multiple vims can use zoom-in/out without interfering with one another\n\nA later version may be available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#ZOOMWIN .\n\nWhen zooming in, ZoomWin's window is full sized, with no loss of screen space to status lines for other windows, unlike vimscript#1280 (ToggleOnly), for those vims compiled with the +mksession feature.  For those vims without that feature, v21 ZoomWin now supports partial-zoom-in (leaves a status line behind for each window).\n\nHistory:\n\nRon Aaron came up with the original ZoomWin and gave permission to have it posted.\n",
  "install_details": " The latest version of ZoomWin uses vimball, so with vim 7.1 its particularly easy to install:\n  vim ZoomWin.vba.gz\n  :so %\n  :q\nWith 7.0, you'll need to upgrade your vimball plugin first.\n",
