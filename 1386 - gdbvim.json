  "description": "NOTICE: MICROSOFT WINDOWS IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED BY THIS SCRIPT YET!\n\nI found a very nice plugin called gdbvim. Now I can debug my C / C++ code in VIM with its help. The original copy of the plugin can be found at: vimscript #84. See this link for more information about this plugin.\n\nUnfortunately, I can only set breakpoints with this plugin, but I can't clear the breakpoints set before. So I modified the plugin and made \"toggle breakpoints\" feature possible. Here is my newly patched code. The new gdbvim.vim requires multvars.vim, which can be found at: vimscript #171.\n\nAny comments or suggestions are welcome.",

Added \"Call stacks\" and some other useful menu items.\n\n\nBugs fixed:\n\n  * The previous version may fail to clear some breakpoints under some new version of gdb. Because  such gdb may breaks at two or more different addresses in the binary code when you set breakpoint at only one position of the source code."
