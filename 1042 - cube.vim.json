It applies to autoexec.cfg, package.cfg and any other file which uses Cube script.\n\nMore info about Cube Engine here: http://cube.sourceforge.net/\n\nThis is my first syntax file. Maybe it isn't the best, but it works very well.\n\nFeatures:\n - Support for keyboard keys names only after \"bind\" command. (MOUSE1, MOUSE2,... is also supported)\n - Support for entities names only after \"newent\" and \"clearents\" commands.\n - Support for all cube commands of version 2004_05_22, except \"keymap\" (which you should not use, according to docs).\n - Recognizes special aliases \"level_trigger_xx\" and \"nextmap_xx\".\n\nI don't know if it will work on Vim 5.",
