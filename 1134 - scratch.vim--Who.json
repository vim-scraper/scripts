  "description": "    this script creates a scratch buffer like what emacs does for you, you can write anything there, but its content will not be saved, so DONT put any important things in scrath buffer! Several commands and keymaps will help you.\n\n\nUsage:\n    you can press <F4>s to open the scratch buffer window, and close it by press <F4>s again. the contents of the scratch buffer will not be lost until you quit Vim.\n\n    <F4><S-s> will paste from register \" to the scratch buffer. A blank line is added between pasting.\n\n    You can have only one scratch buffer open in a single Vim instance.\n\n    scratch.vim itself contains detailed description in both English and Chinese.\n\n\n    this scratch.vim is part of Bruce Who's vim package which is not fully finished.\n\n========================================\n\n中文简介(chinese)\n此脚本用于创建一个scratch缓冲区，你可以在这里打草稿，写一些临时的内容而不必创建一个文件，呵呵。但是退出vim后这个缓冲区的内容会消失，所以不要在这里写重要的东西！还定义了一些命令和快捷键。\n\nscratch.vim本身有更详细的说明。",
