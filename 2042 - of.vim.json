  "description": "This script works under CLI Vim (not gvim) and provides a curses interface for switching between / opening files simlar to TextMate's Cmd-T command.  It requires Vim to be compiled with Ruby bindings, and if you want it to keep a history, also for Ruby's sqlite3 bindings to be installed (it makes a db in your home directory, .of.db, where it stores info on recently opened files and preferred shortcuts for certain files).  To open a file called accounts_controller.php, you could simply call OF (I bind it to Alt-T) and type in ac -- a list of files under your working directory come up that have these two letters in any order.  Move up and down with arrows or ^P/^N, scroll with your mouse, or click/enter to select.  Escape gets you out.  This is a work in progress.  The code has no comments and needs to be cleaned up, but it does what I want it to for now, and maybe what you want.\n\nThis may be a little slow if run from a directory with a huge amount of files.  I usually start it from the base of whatever project I'm working on.",

  "install_details": "Make sure you have Ruby bindings compiled into Vim.  They are included in Ubuntu's vim-full package, and can be compiled in with the --enable-rubyinterp option for ./configure if you are compiling from source.  To check if they're working in Vim, type :ruby puts 'Hello'.  \n\nIf you want a working file history, and smart reuse of the shortcuts you use, you'll also need to install Ruby, Sqlite3 and Ruby Sqlite3 bindings on your system (highly recommended, but a pain on some systems):\n\nIn Ubuntu: \n\n sudo apt-get install vim-full ruby libsqlite3-ruby sqlite3  (easy as pie)\n\nVia Yum: \n\n sudo yum install ruby-devel\n sudo yum install sqlite3-devel\n sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby  (there is probably a yum package for ruby-sqlite3, but there wasn't on the machine I tested on)\n\nOS X via MacPorts: (with /opt/local/bin in your path before /usr/bin):\n\n sudo port install ruby\n sudo port install vim +ruby\n sudo port install sqlite3\n sudo port install rb-rubygems\n sudo gem update\n sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby\n\nPut of.vim in your ~/.vim/plugins folder, and bind call OF() to something.  I use Alt-T (in my .vimrc):\nnnoremap ^[t :call OF()<CR>\n(type ^[t like ctrl-v, alt-t)\n\nIf you need to do anything special to install it on another type of system, shoot me an email and I will post the details here.",
