  "description": "When compiled with this patch, Vim will have a new event, \"GetChar\".\n\nThe doc page patch:\n\n\n                            *GetChar*\nGetChar             Called immediately after a character is\n                received from the user or typeahead buffer,\n                and before it is processed.  The character is\n                available in the |v:getchar| variable as a\n                string (not a number).  Changing |v:getchar|\n                changes the value returned by the\n                |getchar()|function.  The |v:getchartype|\n                variable can be blank, 'KeyTyped', or\n                'KeyStuffed', depending on how the character\n                was obtained.  Setting |v:getchar| to ''\n                essentially skips the current character.\n",
