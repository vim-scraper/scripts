'map <unique> gqc :call FormatComment()<CR>'\n\nWhere SILENT is set to '' or 'silent! ', depending upon vim's version (does it have silent?)\n\nThere is some stuff in there to handle our organization's \"standard function header\" comments specially; that 'if' block should be easily located and removed, or modified to your tastes.  If left as-is, you probably wouldn't trigger it anyway (so I left it in there as an example/template).\n\nAlso, we use the convention that single-line 'C' comments should use the //-style, while multi-line comments should use the /*...*/-style; so that's built into the function.  i.e., If a long //-style comment gets formatted onto multiple lines, it will be converted to /*...*/-style; while a /*...*/-style comment that fits onto a single line will be converted to //-style.  If this is not to your liking, it should be easily remedied; there are function calls made to to the conversions, simply comment the call(s) out (or remove them).\n\nThis function allows quick entry/editing of comments without worrying about the line-break formatting.  Once finished, simply hit 'gqc' and the comment is reformatted.",
