  "description": "This plugin provides vim with web browsing and html formatting capabilities. It includes support for history, bookmarks, text highlighting and more. The main motivation is browsing documentation available in html, so don't expect to see any flash animation :)\n\nThe plugin is implemented using vim's ability to embed perl, so you will \nneed to have a perl enabled version of vim to use it. In addition, several \nperl modules are required. The full details are in the INSTALL file.\n\nDocumentation is available in pod form in 'browser.pod', and as a usual vim \nhelp file.\n\nI wrote and tested it with vim version 6.3 and perl 5.8.4 on linux. I expect \nit to work on any variant of unix. An effort was made to make it work on other \nplatforms as well, but this remains mostly untested.\n\nPlease send me any feedback.\n\nEnjoy!\n",

The searching     commands can now have no arguments, taking the word under the cursor, or      the visaully select words as arguments, instead (Thanks to Aditya Mahajan     for the ideas)  - The browser buffer is now non-modifiable by default. It becomes     modifiable only when changing form input values (again thanks to Aditya     Mahajan)  - Added the possibility to save inline images to a file  - Removed the dependence on HTML-Format. The only dependency that remains     for formatting is HTML::TreeBuilder (which is more widely available).  - There is no longer need to patch HTML::TreeBuilder to view encodings     correctly.  - I think vimbrowse.pl finally works on windows (didn't test, though). Some     environment variables might need to be set.  - Various other features and bug fixes - see the ChangeLog for details"
