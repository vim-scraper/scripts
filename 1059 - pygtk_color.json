  "description": "This will add a menu item in gvim called 'Color' that will allow you to insert a web style hex color value (like '#ffffff'), or python RGB tuple (like (255,255,255) ) after the current line (if you know how to insert at current position, send me an email: david.konsumer at gmail. )\n\nScreenshot: http://konsumer.memebot.com/vim_color_select.png\n\nIncluded is a python script called 'color_select' that requires pygtk.\n\nIn windows, you could write one using VB, or install python and pygtk to use it.\n\nMaybe eventually I'll write a wxwindows dialog for everybody.\n\nThe reason I did this, instead of using http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=927 was that I wanted to be able to grab color values from the screen, and I like the gtk2 color dialog alot.\n\nI tested this on Debian unstable with gvim 6.3, python  2.3.4 and pygtk 2.",
  "install_details": "On linux, Put color_select in your path and chmod 755 it.\nPut pygtk_color.vim into your plugin folder (~/.vim/plugin/ or /usr/share/vim/vim63/plugin/ for me.)",
