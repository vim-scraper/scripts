  "description": "rubycomplete is an omni-completion script for ruby. \nIt supports the following:\n  * dynamic completion of in-buffer entities (classes, methods, objects, modules).\n  * rails \n          - inclusion of column-names/fields\n          - helpers included in completions\n  * automatic inclusion of required modules\n  * automatic handling of syntax errors\n\nRubycomplete requires ruby support to work. It uses ruby to process the buffer and introspection to create a list of completions. \nIt is distributed with vim, and as part of the vim-ruby project (http://vim-ruby.rubyforge.org/).\nCVS versions are availible from vim-ruby, major releases will be published here and on my site.\n\nFor more info go to: http://blog.hasno.info/blog/segfault/dev/2006/04/10/vim-7-ruby-omni-completion.html\n",
