  "description": "Often i need to close some other window and keep working in current window.\nFor example, if i read some help in upper window, and i edit code in lower\nwindow. In the definite moment i decide to close help window. To do it,\ni have to press \"Ctrl_W k :q\".\n\nNot very short. And this is not the worse variant.\nOther variant:\n\n+-----------------+-----------------+\n|      help           |                        |\n|     window      |                        |\n|                         |     current      |\n+-----------------+     window     |\n|                         |                        |\n|                         | <cursor>       |\n|                         |                        |\n|                         |                        |\n+-----------------+-----------------+\n\nFocus is in the 'current window', cursor is on the <cursor> sign. \nI want to close 'help window' and keep working in current window.\n\nThat's what i need to do: \n\nCtrl_W h Ctrl_W k :q Ctrl_W l\n\nThis is very long!\nSo, i wrote this plugin to make it easy.\n\nIt provides 5 commands.\n\nFirstly, four commands for most-frequently actions:\n\n      :Qh means \"close left window and go back\"\n      :Qj means \"close lower window and go back\"\n      :Qk means \"close upper window and go back\"\n      :Ql means \"close right window and go back\"\n\nAnd one universal command:\n      :Q <args>, where <args> is movement commands to needed window.\n      \n      For example, \":Q hk\" means \"Go to the left window, then go to upper window,\n                                  close it and go back to source window\"\n\n      So, this long long command \"Ctrl_W h Ctrl_W k :q Ctrl_W l\"\n      is truncated to short expression: \":Q hk\"\n\nThere's one optional dependency: CmdAlias plugin (vimscript #746).\n\nIf CmdAlias is installed, then lowercased aliases of commands will be available:   :qh, :qj, :qk, :ql, :q <args>.\nI found it useful.\n\n\nPlease NOTE: \n\n1) if :Q without arguments is passed, then current window becomes closed.\n   (to provide compatibility of lowercased command :q)\n\n2) If argument is passed, but target window is the same as current window, then\n   no window will be closed.\n",
