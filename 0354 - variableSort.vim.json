  "description": "This is  a sorting function which  takes the name of  an array-like variable\nwhich ends  in numerical  subscripts along  the lines  of var0,  var1, var2.\nThese can be created quite easily with the var{i} notation of Vim 6.\n\nOther parameters are the starting  and ending subscripts (inclusive) and the\ndirection of the sort (1 or 'a' for ascending, otherwise descending).\n\nThe array is sorted in place; there is no return value from the function.\n\nOptional  argument  is the  name  of  a swap  function  that  takes the  two\nsubscripts  and  swaps the  variable  (there  is  one provided  that  should\nactually be good enough for most  cases; however, if something special needs\nto be  done for the swap  -- such as  multiple records, then this  should be\nused.  In this  case, it  is  assumed the  swap function  already knows  the\nvariables it's going to swap and thus aren't passed in.)\n\nSample custom swap function:\nfunction! MultipleRangeSwap( sub1, sub2 )\n  let temp = b:rangeS{a:sub1}\n  let b:rangeS{a:sub1} = b:rangeS{a:sub2}\n  let b:rangeS{a:sub2} = temp\n\n  let temp = b:rangeE{a:sub1}\n  let b:rangeE{a:sub1} = b:rangeE{a:sub2}\n  let b:rangeE{a:sub2} = temp\nendfunction\n\nSample call:\ncall SortArray( \"b:rangeS\", 0, b:numRanges - 1, 1, \"MultipleRangeSwap\" )\n\nThis will perform an ascending sort  on a variable sequence named b:rangeS0,\nb:rangeS1 etc.,  using the MultipleRangeSwap  function for the  actual swap.\nThis function  was needed here  because two  variables needed to  be swapped\ntogether  even though  only  one was  used  in the  sort.  The default  swap\nwould've only swapped b:rangeS variables, leaving the b:rangeE variables out\nof sync.",
