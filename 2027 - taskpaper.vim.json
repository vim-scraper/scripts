  "description": "From the TaskPaper website (http://hogbaysoftware.com/projects/taskpaper):\n\n  \"TaskPaper is a simple to-do list application that helps you stay\norganized. Unlike competing applications, TaskPaper is based on plain text\nfiles which offer you paper-like simplicity and ease of use.\" \n\nTaskPaper is a to-do list application for Mac OS X based on the \"Getting\nThings Done\" approach of David Allen (http://www.davidco.com/). It supports\nthe GTD notions of projects, tasks and contexts.\n\nThis package contains a syntax file and a file-type plugin for the simple\nformat used by the TaskPaper application. It is intended for Mac users who\nwant to edit their TaskPaper lists in Vim from time to time (for example, in\na SSH session, or on a non-Mac system) and for anyone who is looking for a\nsimple to-do list format.\n",
  "install_details": "It should be safe to simply unpack the package into your .vim directory.\nIt contains the following files:\n  doc/taskpaper.txt\n  doc/example.taskpaper\n  doc/taskpaper_licence.txt\n  ftplugin/taskpaper.vim\n  syntax/taskpaper.vim\n  ftdetect/taskpaper.vim",
