  "description": "The Command-T plug-in provides an extremely fast, intuitive mechanism for opening files with a minimal number of keystrokes. It's named \"Command-T\" because it is inspired by the \"Go to File\" window bound to Command-T in TextMate.\n\nFiles are selected by typing characters that appear in their paths, and are ordered by an algorithm which knows that characters that appear in certain locations (for example, immediately after a path separator) should be given more weight.\n\nFor more details and demonstration screencasts seen on the official Command-T website:\n\n  https://wincent.com/products/command-t\n\nThe latest version of the documentation can be viewed in the project Git repository:\n\n  http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/command-t.txt",

  "install_details": "To install open the vimball archive in Vim:\n\n  vim command-t.vba\n\nThen source it:\n\n  :so %\n\nThe C extension must also be then compiled; for instance, if Vimball installs your plugin files in ~/.vim, then you would do this:\n\n  cd ~/.vim/ruby/command-t\n  ruby extconf.rb\n  make\n\nNote that Command-T requires a version of VIM with Ruby support enabled, and it must be compiled using the same version of Ruby that Vim itself links against. For more details see the documentation:\n\n  http://git.wincent.com/command-t.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/command-t.txt",
