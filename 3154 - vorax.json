  "description": "VoraX aims to be a simple, yet a powerful IDE for Oracle databases. Instead of reinventing the wheel, VoraX relies on the well-known SqlPLUS which is actually used to connect to the database, to execute and to get the results back. However, this interaction is hidden from the user who just uses his/her Vim environment without knowing that, behind, a SqlPLUS process does all the work.\n\nThe big advantage of this approach is that, in VoraX, almost all SqlPLUS commands may be used without any problems. You can format columns, set pagination, autotrace queries etc. Basically, everything you used to type on your SqlPLUS prompt is guaranteed to work in VoraX, except maybe for some exotic cases (e.g. using vim in console mode, having the EDITOR set to a terminal editor and executing the \"ed\" sqlplus command).\n\nAnother advantage is that you'll get an efficient Oracle IDE with a very small footprint. For Oracle DBAs this is huge because they don't need heavy tools with a lot of features they never use. Likewise, the fact that VoraX may be used within a regular console makes it suitable for server environments.\n\nFEATURES\n\n    * 99.9% of the sqlplus commands supported\n    * advanced code completion system\n    * Windows and UNIX systems are supported\n    * a nice results window with highlighting for errors and logging support \n    * a database explorer which may be used to browse the database objects in a hierarchical way\n    * support for editing and compiling PLSQL objects like packages, types etc.\n\nThis project is hosted on: http://code.google.com/p/vorax/",

  "install_details": "VoraX follows the standard procedure of installing a Vim plugin. However, you need to take care of some dependencies VoraX relies on:\n\n   1. your vim must have ruby support enabled. In order to check this you may execute :version and look for +ruby.\n   2. ruby 1.8 (1.8.7 is the recommended version)\n   3. rubygems (on Debian systems is as simple as: sudo apt-get install rubygems)\n   4. the antlr3 ruby gem. You may install it using: gem install antlr3 -r\n   5. for Windows OS, besides ruby, you'll also need the win32-api gem. You may install it using: gem install win32-api -r\n   6. a working Oracle client with sqlplus, which has to be available in the environment $PATH variable. The instant client with sqlplus should be just fine.\n   7. optionally, if you want to securely store passwords for your Oracle connections then the openssl ruby extension must be available. On Ubuntu/Debian systems you may use the following command to install it: sudo apt-get install libopenssl-ruby1.8 \n\nPlease notice that only ruby 1.8 is supported for the moment therefore be careful not to install ruby 1.9 instead.\n\nOptionally, you may install the following plugins VoraX integrates with:\n\n    * NERDTree: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658\n    * XpTemplate: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2611 \n    * TagList: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273\n    * FuzzyFinder: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1984\n\nAfter the installation is done it is advisable to index the documentation using the following commands:\n\n    * :helptags $VIM/.vim/doc (Unix)\n    * :helptags $VIM/vimfiles/doc (Windows) ",
