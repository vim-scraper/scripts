Such\nfiles should generally not exist, but alas they do, and\nsometimes we need to make changes to them.\n\nThis script helps by opening a small window in your Vim\nsession and keeping up-to-date with a few lines of text\ndescribing your cursor&#039s current scope or context in a C\nfile.\n\nhttp://www.bluweb.com/us/chouser/proj/ctx/\n",
