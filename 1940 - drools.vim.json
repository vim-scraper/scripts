This does a ton of borrowing from the existing Java syntax file, as written by Claudio Fleiner <claudio@fleiner.com>, so I hope he doesn't mind. This is just an initial version that I wrote to make writing DROOLS files a little more bearable, so if you see any desired improvements, just e-mail me and let me know. Thanks!",
