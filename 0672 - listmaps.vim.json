If maps are defined in the script then\nthey will list below the script name. Initially this will\nappear folded.\n\nYou can then inspect the maps in a script or search for a\nmap to find out where it was defined. \n\nTo use\n\n   :Listmaps\n\nIt pulls out just about anything that looks like it might be\na map for completeness. There will be a few a lines that the\nscript mistakes for a map, but which aren't. And it may be a\nlittle slow.\n",
