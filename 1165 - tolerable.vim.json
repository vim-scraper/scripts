  "description": "This  black-on-white colorscheme uses simple, easily identifiable colors, but shouldn't be too gaudy. The scheme was inspired by BBEdit and other Mac OS text editors that have adopted similar color schemes. Unlike BBEdit, comments are low-contrast, and split boundaries are not too stark.",
