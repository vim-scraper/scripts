  "description": "Here is an archive containing different functions and commands aimed at (ft)plugins\ndeveloppers.\n\nYou fill find :\n- functions to define context dependent mappings : i.e. mappings that won't expand\n  within comment or string context -> MapNoContext() & MapNoContext2()\n- a function that insert a pair of tokens around a visual area -> MapAroundVisualLine()\n- a function that expands mappings contained into strings -> BuildMapSeq()\n- commands that eats the <spaces> you hit at the end of abbreviations\n\n- a set of definitions to insert markers and jump to them (derived from Stephen \n  Riehm bracketing system) ; the markers can be customized, erased or deleted, \n  etc.\n\n- my bracketing system : through a set of buffer-relative options, we can activate \n  (and tune) the insertion of pairs of brackets when we hit the opening bracket. It \n  works in insert, normal and visual modes. If markers are available and wanted, \n  they will be inserted in insert-mode.\n  It also proposes functions (from auctex.vim) that delete pairs of brackets, \n  change them (to '{}', '()', or '[]'), toogle backslashes, etc.\n\nYou fill found a much more complete documentation and examples within the archive, and there:\nhttp://hermitte.free.fr/vim/settings.php#brackets",
