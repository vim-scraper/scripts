  "description": "Vimya can be used to execute the contents of a Vim buffer (or the current visual selection) in Autodesk Maya. The plugin will save the commands to be executed in a temporary file and tell Maya via the command port to source this file. Both MEL and Python scripts are supported, Maya's log can optionally be opened in a separate tab in Vim (requires the Tail Bundle plugin vimscript #1714).\n\nImportant: You need a Vim version with built-in Python support to run this plugin!\n\n* news about this plugin: http://ntworks.net/vimya/index.html\n* or as Atom feed: http://ntworks.net/vimya/index.atom\n* the source code is also available at Gitorious: http://gitorious.org/vimya\n* bug tracker: http://code.ntworks.net/Vimya",
