  "description": "This tiny script provides the syntax, folding function and other minor functionality that I need for my notes.\n\nI try to keep al my notes in simple plain ASCII text files. However I admit that some formating and folding is nice. Hence I came up with a very simple syntax based on some markers and indentation rules, wrap all that together into this Vim script and Voil√†! Now I can keep my text notes within a compressed style and smart folding along the power of Vim to ease the access to my notes.\n\nYou can get a longer description and one screenshot at: \n\nhttps://github.com/fgarcia/pnote\n",
