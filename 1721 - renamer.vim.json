  "description": "Basic Usage:\nShow a list of file names in a directory, rename then in the vim \nbuffer using vim editing commands, then have vim rename them on disk\nStart the plugin with the command :Renamer\n\nDetails:\nRenaming a single file is easily done via an operating system file explorer,\nthe vim file explorer (netrw.vim), or the command line.  When you want to\nrename a bunch of files, especially when you want to do a common text\nmanipulation to those file names, this plugin may help.  It shows you all\nthe files in the current directory, and lets you edit their names in the vim\nbuffer.  When you're ready, issue the command \":Ren\" to perform the mass\nrename.  The intention is to rename files in the same directory, but\nrelative paths can be specified to move files around - provided the \ndestination directories exist",
