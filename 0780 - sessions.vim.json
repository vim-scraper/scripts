  "description": "This plugin introduces following additions to regular session management (see\nhelp on viminfo, mkview, mksession):\n- short commands for session saving, loading, clearing and merging:\n  :SS <name> --- save session <name>\n  :SL <name> --- load session <name>\n  :SN <name> --- clear buffer list and set new current session name.\n  :SS without parameter saves current session loaded with :SL or created\n      with SN.\n  :SM <name> --- merge session <name> into current one.\n\n- All sessions are stored and loaded out of specific directory named\n  'sessions' in &runtimepath. \n  Note: it is nessessary to create this directory manually before using\n  plugin. E.g. 'mkdir -p ~/.vim/sessions' will do on Unix-like systems.\n\n- Session name argument does not need to have path prefix or extension. It's\n  also may be completed from already saved session names.\n\n- Major difference to built-in session mechanism is that saved session by\n  default does not contain any mapping, window layout, line number or\n  unlisted buffer information whatsoever. There's just file list and current\n  working directory/file. This is done intentionally, with robustness and\n  loading speed in mind (see help on viminfo to learn how to store file\n  marks across sessions). To enable old-stype session files, set variable\n  g:Sessions_Old_style = 1 in your .vimrc.\n",
