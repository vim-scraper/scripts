  "description": "My $0.02 worth of...\nWorking with DNA sequences, especially if you don't have a Unix machine handy might need a few tools. Some of the modifications are simple enough that even a trivial Vim script would deal with.\nWhat you can do:\n- get the reverse-complement of a sequence\n- count A/T/C/Gs in a sequence and get a very crude Tm for a primer\n- brush-up a few file formats (PS from ClustalX, FASTA etc).\n\nMany thanks to Will Nater and Tim Chase for helping!\n\nVersion \"1.0\" means that, up to now, I did not have any screwed-up sequence, but this is far from saying that it's definitely foolproof.",
