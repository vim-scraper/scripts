In the menu that will pop up you will have the option \"(s)earch directory\". Select it by pressing s and type your pattern. If your search will yield results, you will see a window in the lower part of your screen, with all the results. Navigate with the keys and press <CR> to jump to a result. The file will be opened in the last working window.",
  "install_details": "Install NERD_Tree first. Then download this module to ~/.vim/plugin/ or the appropriate location on your system and...you're done.\n\nInstall ack (see details at http://betterthangrep.com/ ). Depending on your operating system, you need to type something like \"sudo apt-get install ack-grep\", \"brew install ack\" or other. Most of the installers will add ack to your $PATH, so NERD_Tree_Ack.vim won't require additional configuration. If you're weird and don't want to add ack to your $PATH, just add the following line to your .vimrc file:\n\nlet g:path_to_search_app = \"/full/path/to/ack\"\n\nIt should work.",
