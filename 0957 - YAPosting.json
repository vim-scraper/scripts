  "description": "[OUTDATED: not been tested for vim 7... Updates are welcome !]\n\nThis script was designed in order to have a simple but reliable, comprehensive and reusable set of mappings, functions and syntax in order to improve the Mailing and Posting edition. It does 'clean' the quotes in the mail (removes empty quoted lines, condense quote signs and remove signature), it changes Microsoft Outlook Express quote header to a standard quote header and put the quote where it belongs, it can remove quoted or not quoted paragraphs and it can reformat your text into \na justified text inside margins.\n\nThere still are some minor Bugs which I'll get rid of one day, and some feature I shall add to it... But obviously, time is not extensible, and I don't know when I'll have enough to really make this script perfect... Anyway, I'm using this script every day when I edit E-Mails, and I really enjoy using it. :)\n\nI'd also like to thanks Luc Hermitte who made a good critic of my script.\n\nUSAGE :\nthe default keybindings are :\n    tc : clean the mail (removes empty quoted lines, removes signature...)\n    tm : move a MS/OE signature to the top of the quotation, and change the quotation tag.\n    tt : takeout a paragraph (or a quoted paragraph)\n         you will be prompt to enter a reason to put inside the square brackets (like [snip])\n    tr : reformat the current paragraph in order to have it belonging your formating rules\n          (you can change them by editing the script, or changing global variables :\n            g:par_marginleft\n            g:par_marginright\n            g:par_textwidth\n            g:par_alinea\n           )\n    th : toggle highlighting of 72 and 80 columns limits \n          (texts after 72 column will appear yellow, and after 80 will appear red).",
