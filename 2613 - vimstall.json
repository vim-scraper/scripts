To use it on a bunch of just downloaded vim plugins\nyou can do following (I consider you put downloaded scripts into\n~/.vim/update/ and keep vimstall.sh in ~/.vim/scripts/, if not, adjust\ncommands according your case):\n\n$ cd ~/.vim/update/\n$ ../scripts/vimstall.sh .\n\nWait a little and check if all plugins are installed/updated.\nIf vimstall.sh meet some files he don't know how to handle, it will (or at\nleast should) cry about it into stderr.\n\nIf anything went wrong, email me at kstep<at>p-nut<dot>info,\nwith detailed bug description and a way to reproduce it.\nI'll be happy to fix it.\n",
