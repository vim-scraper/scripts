If nothing else, this is a very good start on a complete smarty syntax file.  We have even used vimtip #498 to use autocomplete with this syntax and so far it seems to work well.",

  "install_details": "just drop it in your ~/.vim/syntax directory, then put this somewhere in your vimrc file: \n\nau BufRead,BufNewFile *.tpl set filetype=smarty\n\nadditionally, if you would like dictionary completion, feel free to add something like this:\n\nau Filetype smarty exec('set dictionary=/home/user/.vim/syntax/smarty.vim')\nau Filetype smarty set complete+=k\n\nThis will allow <Control-x><Control-k> for dictionary autocomplete. \nWe have a mapping that makes it a bit easier:\n\nimap <S-Space><S-Space> <C-X><C-K>\n\nYou could use imap <C-Space> <C-X><C-K>, but we have that mapped for normal omni (auto) completion.",
