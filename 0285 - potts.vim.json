If you switch to a lighter\nscheme, it may not be very visible. \n\nIt works pretty well on transparent term windows, better if you can partially shade them.\n\nSorry it doesn't have a flashy name, but it doesn't seem to have any theme to it.\nScreen shots at http://pottsdl.github.com/colors.html\nScreen shot of console vim and GUI (Motif) vim.",
