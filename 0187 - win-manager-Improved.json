  "description": "Introduction:\n-----------------\n  This plugin will help user in quick traversal between various directories in a project, across the filesystems. This allows user to create shortcuts to directories. All shortcuts created by user are persistent across sessions and are available through the menu. Users who don't have a graphical interface can access menu through wild menu options.\n   All shortcuts created are stored in a text file which user can modify, if he has confidence. \n                  Support for adding current directory to shortcuts and direct access to shortcuts file has been given.(v 1.01)\n\n\nUsage:\n---------\n   Use Dir-shortcut menu to add shortcuts and traverse to them.\n   All commands of winmanager can be used as earlier. A summary of what might be needed by you follows:\n   :WManager\tto start Windows manager\n   :WMClose\tto close it\n   :WMtoggle\tto toggle between visible and hidden modes of winmanager.\n\n Testing:\n ----------\n \tI'm using these scripts from about a month now and feel they work good enough to be released to users.\n\n Thanks :\n ----------\n    Srinath for the wonderful script he has written.\n    To the vim-community, who encourage people even like me to contribute to make vim the best editor. \n    To my team mates for valuable support and suggestions I get from them.\n\n\nSuggestions and Bugs:\n---------------------------------\n    Report suggestion and bugs directly to me at anubhav47@hotmail.com. \n",
