  "description": "This plugin is a minor bug-fix version of vimscript #95.\n\nI sent the patches to the author of winmanager last September but I've received no reply till now.  I assume that he doesn't maintain this script any more.  So I decide to upload my patched version as a new entry.\n\nOne new feature of this plugin is called \"start\".  When you are browsing files with winfileexplorer, just place your cursor onto a file and press \"S\" (shift-s), Vim will open the file with the application associated with the file type. So you are able to launch a media player to enjoy the music without opening an extra konqueror or nautilus.\n\nAnother new feature of this plugin is \"toggle show hidden files/directories\".  By default, this plugin doesn't show files/directories prefixed with dot \".\".  You can toggle show/hide hidden files/directories by pressing \"x\" in the file explorer window.  You can override this default setting by putting \"let g:explShowHiddenFiles = 1\" in your \"~/.vimrc\" to make it show hidden files/directories by default.",

  "install_details": "1. This plugin is compressed in VimBall format. So you may need to install the latest version of vimscript #1502 first.\n\n2. Then the just download this Vimball, opening it in Vim and typing this command followed by an enter in your Vim:\n\n:so %\n\n3. For Windows users, \"start\" is already installed in your system so just skip this step; for Linux users, create a symbolic link named \"start\" in one of your $PATH directory, pointing to \"~/.vim/plugin/start.kde\" or \"~/.vim/plugin/start.gnome\", depending to your desktop environment (other desktop environments are not supported yet); for Mac users, \"start\" feature is unavailable yet.\n\n4. Install vimscript #42. If you don't want to use that plugin, just add this line in your .vimrc to disable the integration of bufexplorer.vim:\n\nlet g:winManagerWindowLayout = \"FileExplorer\"\n\n5. Enjoy and happy Vimming!",
