If none is found, a - sign is inserted before the number.",

But now it works, if you clicked with the mouse on the word and accidentally switched on visual mode...)\nI realised that <C-S-T> is the same than <C-T> I didn't intent to break these mappings, but since I didn't find another suitable keymapping, I now use <C-T>. Anyone who doesn't like that can change that easily."
