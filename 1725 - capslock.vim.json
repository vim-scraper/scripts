  "description": "This plugin enables a software caps lock.  This is advantageous over a regular caps lock in that normal mode commands, other buffers, and other applications are unaffected.\n\nThe default mapping is <C-G>c but if you use this feature regularly, you will probably want a shorter one.  Simply map something to <Plug>CapsLockToggle and you are good to go.  The default behavior is to disable caps lock when leaving insert mode, but this is customizable too.\n\nA couple of functions are provided for adding a caps lock indicator to the statusline.\n",
