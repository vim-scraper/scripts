  "description": "The script uses some connection settings to get a list of tables.\nThen it gets the current sql command which is separated either by ; or by newlines from other sql commands. It gets a list of field names of all tables occuring within the command.\nBased on those tables it generates the completion list by getting data db scheme information from database.\nIf there are any aliases such as \"`foo` as f\" and you start completion after\nf. only the fields from that table will be listed.\nBefore AS or after FROM only the list of tables is used.\n\nOf course you can also execute the current command by defining a mapping such as\n  nnoremap <buffer> <F2> :echo b:db_conn.query(join(vl#dev#sql#sql#ThisCommand(),\"\\n\"))<cr>\n\nHowever this should be done the way dbext.vim does it (TODO)",
  "install_details": "Unzip the and source the .vim installer file.\nIt will ask you where to install the script and ask for confirmaiton before taking any action. It will tell you about files which will be overridden if any.\nUse the following commands to get started:\n\ncall vl#dev#sql#sql#Connect('mysql', {'user':'root', 'password' :'pwd'})\nsetlocal omnifunc=vl#dev#sql#sql#Complete\n\nLook the other configuration settings up in autoload/vl/dev/sql/sql.vim file\n\nasterisks (*) are not yet quoted correctly. This matters if this char appears in your password.\nYou should just add a* to autoload/vl/lib/system/system.vim line 30 so that it looks like this:\nlet cmd .=  ' '.escape(a, \"* '\\\"\\\\`\")  \"thanks nottha_k for finding this issue\n\n\nContact me if you have any suggestions, feedback, patches or encounter any problems.",
