Also allows for syntax highlighting if Vim is set as external editor in Autobahn.\n\nThis is a very rough file, improvements are welcome. I may also be the only one that would actually use this. If you like it or want something changed, please email me at patrick dot rubbs dot regan at gmail dot com.",
