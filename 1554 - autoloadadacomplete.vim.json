Here some important tips:\n\n1) You need to compile your code first and use the \"-aO\" option to point to your .ali files.\n2) \"gnat xref -v ../Include/adacl.ads\" won't work - use  the \"gnat xref -v -aI../Include adacl.ads\" instead.\n3) \"gnat xref -v -aI../Include *.ad?\" won't work - use \"cd ../Include\" and then \"gnat xref -v *.ad?\"\n4) Project manager support is completely broken - don't even try \"gnat xref -Padacl.gpr\".\n5) VIM is faster when the tags file is sorted - use \"sort --unique --ignore-case --output=tags tags\" .\n6) Remember to insert \"!_TAG_FILE_SORTED\t2\t%sort ui\" as first line.\n\nReports errors to: http://code.google.com/p/vim-scripts/issues/list\nDiscuss improvements on: http://groups.google.com/group/vim_scripts\n",
