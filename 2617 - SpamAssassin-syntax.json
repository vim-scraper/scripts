Each plugin section is fully independent and therefore can easily be deactivated or used as a model for a new plugin.  Rewrapped to wider view since lines were way over the 80-col size anyway.  Things are more properly contained now as well.  Removed abstraction for highlighting due to increased version dependency.  Added support for sa3.3 plugins and the remaining missing shipped plugins, plus iXhash.  Fixed regex detection (m// and friends were broken in 3.0)."

It's pretty much done now, so I don't expect more releases.  There are two remaining TODO items:  one for reorganization (code cleanup) which is mostly unnecessary, and one assuming there is more perl highlighting to disable/tweak (though I haven't seen any evidence recently).  One more TODO is the recognition of regexs using alternate bounding characters like apostrophe instead of slash."
