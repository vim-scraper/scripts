I haven't touched this since 5/4/9, as reflected in internal release date, but I (wrongly) figured I'd tweak it more before another release.  It's pretty much done now, so I don't expect more releases.  There are two remaining TODO items:  one for reorganization (code cleanup) which is mostly unnecessary, and one assuming there is more perl highlighting to disable/tweak (though I haven't seen any evidence recently).  One more TODO is the recognition of regexs using alternate bounding characters like apostrophe instead of slash."
