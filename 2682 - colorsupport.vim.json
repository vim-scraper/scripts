  "description": "colorsupport.vim\n================\nUse colorschemes written for gvim in color terminals.\nTested with many colorschemes including color sampler pack (vimscript #625)\n\nFor a 256-color terminal, see\n\n- http://www.frexx.de/xterm-256-notes/\n- http://www.nabble.com/screen%2C-256color-mode-and-ssh-td15098157.html\n- http://push.cx/2008/256-color-xterms-in-ubuntu\n\nAnd don't forget to rate ;^)\n\nComparison\n----------\nAt the time that I uploaded this script, I was unaware of other color conversion scripts.\nAnd I've tried them later.\n\nvimscript #2390. (Thank you marty)\n\nKey difference is that vimscript #2390 practically requires gvim installed.\nAnd major difficulty (and dirty tricks) of this script was to get gui \nattributes from colorschemes, which are not obtainable from series of \nsynIDxxx() functions without +gui feature.  \n\nvimscript #1809\n\nvimscript #1809 tries to extract hilight information by string match.\n(I assume that this approach is what most conversion script have took)\nBy contrast, colorsupport.vim actually run the original color scheme \nwith highlight command substituted with Highlight command.\nLater works better because many color schemes have highlights\nin conditional block, which should not be extracted.\n\nFurthermore, vimscript #1809 does not support color names.\n\nSimple usage\n------------\n- Drop 'colorsupport.vim' in '~/.vim/plugin'.\n\n  At next startup, colorscheme loaded by '.vimrc' will be reloaded with gui\n  colors mapped to terminal palette.  That is, if you already have gvim\n  colorscheme set in '~/.vimrc', then it'll work as soon as you install the\n  'colorsupport.vim' script.\n\n- Browse and preview colorschemes in your &runtimepath by\n  ':ColorSchemeBrowse'.  You can also manually try colorschemes using\n  ':ColorScheme', just like ':colorscheme'.\n\n- On slow systems, it can take long to convert colorscheme every time vim\n  starts up.  For faster start-up, save last colorscheme by ':ColorSchemeSave'.\n\n  By default, this saves last colorscheme loaded by ':ColorScheme' in the first \n  &runtimepath (usually, ~/.vim/colors on Unix).\n\n  If last colorscheme is already from '~/.vim/colors', error will occur,  and\n  you should use ':ColorSchemeSave <new-colorscheme-name>' instead.\n\nUpgrade\n-------\nWhen upgrading colorsupport.vim, additional color groups can be set, \nbut color schemes saved by :ColorSchemeSave passes conversion by :ColorScheme.\nDelete old (converted and saved) color schemes if you want re-convert.\n\nCustomization\n-------------\n- g:colorsupport_palette_name (one of \"tango\" (default), \"console\", \"xterm\", \"rxvt\")\n- g:colorsupport_palette (e.g., ['#000000',  ...]. (length better be =16))\n\n- g:colorsupport_cube_name (one of \"xterm256\", \"xterm88\", \"konsole\", \"eterm\")\n- g:colorsupport_cube (e.g. [0x00, 0x2A, 0x55, 0xAA, 0xD4])\n\n- g:colorsupport_grey (e.g., range(0x1C, 0xFF, 30))\n\n- g:colorsupport_rgbs (e.g., ['/usr/X11/share/X11'])\n\nKeep {len(g:colorsupport_palette) + len(g:colorsupport_cube)^3 + len(g:colorsupport_grey) == &t_Co}\n\nCommands\n--------\n- Highlight ... \n\n  Arguments are the same as :highlight\n  Set 'cterm', 'ctermfg', 'ctermbg' based on 'gui', 'guifg', 'guibg',\n  respectively.  Note that given 'cterm.*' settings are ignored.\n\n- ColorScheme <path-or-name>\n\n  Load a colorscheme using ':Highlight', instead of ':highlight'.\n  Unlike colorscheme, path is accepted as well as colorscheme name.\n\n- ColorSchemeBrowse [<path>]\n\n  Browse colorschemes in <path> (or &runtimepath, if no arguments given)\n\n- ColorSchemeSave [<name>]\n\n  Save last colorscheme loaded by ':ColorScheme' (or, equivalently, browsed by\n  ':ColorSchemeViewer') in the first &runtimepath.  If <name> is not given,\n  original name of last colorscheme is used.",
