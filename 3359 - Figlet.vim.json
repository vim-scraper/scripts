  "description": "Use the g@ operator or the :Figlet command to filter your text through figlet, in-place!\n:Figlet has a completion function that will complete on installed font names, too.\n\nPlus, there is a Windows/MS-DOS version of Figlet, so everybody can get in on the fun!\n\nQ: Can't I do this same thing with the :! command?\nA: Basically, sure\n\nQ: What does this plugin give me that Vim's built-in filtering doesn't?\nA1. Convenience - through variables it can remember your defaults\nA2. Completion - so you don't have to memorize all of the commands or font names\nA3. Text-objects - use the g@ operator with text-objects for blazing fast transformations that will knock shoulder-surfer's socks off\nA4. A font sample buffer to help you pick out the perfect font for the occasion\n\nQ: Okay, I'm sold.  But what is this Figlet you speak of?\nA: This:\n  __ _       _      _   \n / _(_) __ _| | ___| |_ \n| |_| |/ _` | |/ _ \\ __|\n|  _| | (_| | |  __/ |_ \n|_| |_|\\__, |_|\\___|\\__|\n       |___/            \n\nEr, that wasn't quite as impressive as I was hoping.
