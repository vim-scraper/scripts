  "description": "I got sick of color schemes that used every color and highlighted every possible item.\n\nThis basic color scheme gets rid of syntax highlighting for numbers, variables, and function names.  It keeps the colors for comments, strings, errors, and special information that's not actually in the document like line numbers.\n\nThis allows you to easily see if you've forgotten to terminate a string or comment, without being overwhelmed by the colors of everything else.",
