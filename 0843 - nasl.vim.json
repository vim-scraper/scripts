If you don't have access to that directory, then you can put it somewhere in your ~/.vim directory, not sure where...\n\nTo have the nasl files be automatically recognized by the .nasl filename, you will need to edit the filetype.vim file on your system, adding an entry like this:\n\n\" Nasl script file\nau BufNewFile,BufRead *.nasl                    setf nasl\n\nThat way, the nasl.vim file will load automatically upon running :syntax enable, as long as you're editing a file which ends in .nasl (I'll work on having .inc files recognized as well).",
